this morning i woke up to the sounds of an argument between the landlord and my father. the landlord was asking us not to use one specific bathroom because it was leaking. the landlord is a pretty chill uncle, so i was surprised to hear him shouting.the argument was pretty one-sided though. so, i wake up and do my daily duties and that's when my mom comes to me to have a real talk. 

she says that we haven't paid the rent for about 8 months now and she figures that the landlord might ask us to vacate the place. she says your father hasn't been able to provide any income and shakingly admits that she's been asking relatives and people she knows money, to make ends meet.
she says that my education was supported by taking loans from relatives and that we're deep in debt, about 10 lakhs.

a little background about my family:
we're a family of three, my father moved to this city in 1995 because of his job (reputed company) and so did my mother after getting married. things were going pretty good until 2005 when the company announced that they had to merge two branches and the branch in our city will be closed off. they were asking my father to transfer to another city, but keeping my education in mind my parents decided it's best for us to stay here, so my father resigned. my mother, a teacher, was also the earning member.
at this point in the story, my father is about 40 years old and my mother is around 33 years old and i'm 7 years old. my father lands a job in a different company, it's a different job than what he's used to, he doesn't like it. a few years later, the company is forced to close due to losses and my father was laid off. 
my father was unemployed for about a year and my mother became the primary earning member. she teaches yoga as a home tutor. my mother handled things for a few years. fast forward a few years, my father joins my uncle's company, a completely different job this time, and moves to a different city. it has been this way for about 7 years now, things were starting to get back on track, but my father left the job saying the bosses there suck and he can't lick their boots for a petty job. i was aware of this and i was in 4th year of my engineering at this time and i graduated a year later with a job in my hand. the job requires me to stay away from my home city and has a 1 year training period, after which i'll be considered an employee of the company. 

cut to the question:
i was brought up without any of these circumstances affecting me, i never knew about all of this until today and that too only because the landlord came to have an argument and i happened to be awake at that time.

i really adore my mother and father, imagining how hard my mother worked to get me educated brings tears to my eyes. my mother cannot have a proper talk with father about his employment because she's afraid he might break down mentally. my dad is already very depressed (but he pretends he isn't) and also on the brink of his retirement age.i have a job now, and i'll be on the company payrolls as an employee from september.

i don't want my mother to struggle anymore, what can i do, as soon as possible to get rid of all these debts and how can i have some real talk with my father about this situation and how to handle it.",throaway-forprivacy,buddy work making short keep good contact girl classmates see ladies attend mom yoga classes moms friends girl batchmates etc work sales skills never ever go loan interest drain out dont know would advice pick big data skills look product companies dont make sick worry mountains debt 24 months later situation look totally different bear op still young well,644,9,4.208588957055214,5.0,please advice reality punched face today sorry reddit post going long please bear me using throwaway account privacy concerns morning woke sounds argument landlord father landlord asking us use specific bathroom leaking landlord pretty chill uncle surprised hear shouting the argument pretty sided though so wake daily duties that mom comes real talk says paid rent 8 months figures landlord might ask us vacate place says father able provide income shakingly admits asking relatives knows money make ends meet says education supported taking loans relatives we re deep debt 10 lakhs little background family we re family three father moved city 1995 job reputed company mother getting married things going pretty good 2005 company announced merge two branches branch city closed off asking father transfer another city keeping education mind parents decided best us stay here father resigned mother teacher earning member point story father 40 years old mother around 33 years old 7 years old father lands job different company different job he used to years later company forced close due losses father laid off father unemployed year mother became primary earning member teaches yoga home tutor mother handled things years fast forward years father joins uncle company completely different job time moves different city way 7 years now things starting back track father left job saying bosses suck can t lick boots petty job aware 4th year engineering time graduated year later job hand job requires stay away home city 1 year training period ll considered employee company cut question brought without circumstances affecting me never knew today landlord came argument happened awake time really adore mother father imagining hard mother worked educated brings tears eyes mother cannot proper talk father employment afraid might break mentally dad already depressed but pretends isn t brink retirement age job now ll company payrolls employee september want mother struggle anymore do soon possible rid debts real talk father situation handle

we(m22|f25) are in relationship from past three year.
we both have already planned for marriage after being in relationship for 1 year .



we also know each other since high school so we are quite compatible and have a good understanding of each other.



things are going not as i supposed to go .


now she have changed her mind completely.


a brief background about her - she have a poverty based childhood and she have worked part time throughout her life to afford her family needs and her father was nothing less than a person just existing,never supported her and her mother.


even now she and her mother supports the family.


no one respects her family as they are poor.


she feel no one respects her in society because they are poor which is true considering indian society mentality.



now she refuse to marry me saying she would marry someone richer as i am also not in very good financial condition though i have a job in computer science field and i need three more years to settle down completely and her family will be marrying her after two year.


she wants to marry someone richer as groom is expected to be earning more than bride in indian society so she do have chances of marrying someone settled.
she wants to rest and enjoy her life.


she said she have all the right to choose what's best for her.


she can decide whom to marry or not and i can't put pressure on her to marry me.


she also told me that she don't want to be part of me when i am struggling.


she will marry me only if i get settled in the next two year(bought a house and starts earnings well to manage both emi and lifestyle)


if she decides to marry me she have to work maybe for one year which she clearly said no that she don't want to marry me as if things don't workout the way we think then she will end up cursing me for snatching her opportunity of marrying someone richer.

i asked her that i will try my best to give her best life but i need one year of support from her so that i can buy a house on emi but she ends up breaking up.

i can't help but rationlize why i was struck. my friend says that i was assaulted by the cop because he says that it wasn't the right for the cop to hit me, as he was also stopped by a cop when he was walking his dog for not wearing a mask. he then stated his reasons and then the cops told him to wear a mask and started petting his dog (my friend btw, is indian and lives in a middle eastern country). was it right for the cop to strike me? i can't help but think from both perspectives and always end up thinking that maybe i should've worn a mask, and this whole thing wouldn't have happened. what do you guys think?

neither do i think that the cop had the best intentions in mind as i think he would've conveyed his point in a better way by actually telling me to wear a mask first. as far as i've heard, the cops in this country are far from the best but i shouldn't judge them individually based on what i may have heard but i cannot deny what i've heard or read anyway.",sataniscraycray,wrong cop hit legally sanchar bandh,402,6,3.9106699751861043,3.3333333333333335,got struck cop today meds mentally physically handicapped niece fault forgetting wear mask stopped cop civillian clothing asked outside stated reason asked wearing mask told truth struck cop swat bat thingy thrice point decided floor bike dipped fool speed can t help rationlize struck friend says assaulted cop says right cop hit me stopped cop walking dog wearing mask stated reasons cops told wear mask started petting dog my friend btw lives middle eastern country right cop strike me can t help think perspectives always end thinking maybe worn mask whole thing happened guys think edit thank guys clearing views situation gone through mention but sort new came last year complete ug take account cops might different perspective compared cops raised e middle east admit wrong wearing mask however think right thing cop hit considering showed proof reason outside first place neither think cop best intentions mind think would ve conveyed point better way actually telling wear mask first far ve heard cops country far best judge individually based may heard cannot deny ve heard read anyway

AskIndia,"are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?",10,fx71yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx71yh/are_peopleespecially_men_really_okay_with_with/,105,2020-04-09 03:36:18,"note: i am not saying this should apply to only women. same applies to men too (you can reverse the genders in below). it is not right that women need not worry about their husbands past(they can and should)

a little background: i am a bit on the introverted spectrum, i live in a little bubble(not much contact/info on what goes around, especially people's lives or how the trends are currently). my parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, i am now 29). i always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. and, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). i understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still i thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). even if they did have, i thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). but, wow!, was i totally wrong. it appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).

**i came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people i know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from quora. to my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner's first and last(and being your partner's first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that i shouldnt expect so, not in a - ""hey, its not practical man"" way, but in a ""you just cant"" way). when asked if i can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner's past is none of your concern.

i still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am i to judge how should one live. but when i asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife's/husband's past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, i could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). i for one cannot understand this. **it appears i am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person i am going to share my life with did things with someone else. i am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something i can just forget/get-past-it easily.**

**my questions are -**

1. am i the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe's past? i am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe i didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)
2. if i am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?
3. or, am i just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that i am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and i am just being paranoid?
4. why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.

please dont label me as backward/prudish, i am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and i believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and i am not mysogynist either. just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).

and sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.

&#x200b;

ps:

by intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.

and i am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again i might be wrong(i am happy to stand corrected)

so we screwed this up pretty badly. my boyfriend is indian-american, his parents are south indian and arrived in the late 90s. they're pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he's their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he's dated anyone they've given him an extremely hard time about it.

switch to me. i'm very in love with him. we've been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. he met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn't stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an ldr. he loves me too. we mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. incidentally, i'm canadian. i'm about to graduate from university. once i do, i want to live with him again. the only way i can do that with my credentials is get married. we don't want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.

switch to his parents. because we live apart i only met them once on the pretense that i was his friend, because we didn't think at that point we would stay together. he has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. obviously, they fucking lose it. now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we're too young, etc. all things i deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. but the thing that's plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that i'm not the brahmin doctor they wanted. the not being indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. his mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like ""i'm depressed from all of our financial problems and now you're doing this to hurt me,"" every time he does something they don't like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.

what we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. but we didn't have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. but now our commitment is clear and the cat's out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5am last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. 

i don't expect them to ever accept me. i want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear i don't want their goddamn money. but my boyfriend/fiancee and i want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they'll decide he's ""settled,"" especially if he's settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. i just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. thinking about this call makes me nauseous. they're just gonna tell me i'm useless for however many minutes. 

idk that anyone can give advice but i need to try so i have less of a chance of screwing things up. thanks randia.

my dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. he believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. i tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in china, but he believes that china is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

he also believes that the human rights violations against uyghurs in china is acceptable (!!!) because, and i quote, ""they were trying to convert the chinese to islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, i said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. does our judicial system have flaws? of course, and i agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

i'm currently studying abroad in a western country where i'm obviously a minority, so i naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. i asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

authoritarianism works until it doesn't. authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

i don't know about economics, but is there a possibility that people might die more because of the lockdown rather than coronavirus? many vegetables are absolutely finished in our local markets, and given that most vegetables, meat, etc come through local trains which are now non-operational, how will we get basic stuff like food? from what i know, poor people still have ration card to meet their requirements, and rich people, well, have their money to get through the system. what about most of us? 

another thing is jobs. due to these shutdowns, the businesses will face huge losses, jobs like hawkers, small shops, cottage industries, chaiwala, panwala, panipuriwala, etc will mostly go without any money. and if this lockdown is extended, which it most probably will, won't several million people just die due to lack of money and food?

edit: i sometimes go on libertarian sub (curiosity) and there someone said this that the population cannot sustain this and that this can be solved by just quarantining the old people and nothing else, i.e., no lockdown or travel ban or anything, just quarantining of old people because covid 19 apparently doesn't harm young people. is this really a sound solution?",Death1s1nevitable,many infections economy left save,294,28,4.929054054054054,4.5,stupid serious question point loss life economy due lockdown greater loss life due coronavirus west bengal honestly lockdown scaring really bad prices food items potatoes tomatoes etc risen significantly supplies almost finished many shops sell basic groceries closed owners say afraid arrested police even though groceries exempted even though middle class family know many low income families paranoid situation eat die hunger anyways know economics possibility might die lockdown rather coronavirus many vegetables absolutely finished local markets given vegetables meat etc come local trains non operational basic stuff food know poor still ration card meet requirements rich well money system us another thing jobs due shutdowns businesses face huge losses jobs hawkers small shops cottage industries chaiwala panwala panipuriwala etc mostly go without money lockdown extended probably will several million die due lack money food edit sometimes go libertarian sub curiosity someone said population cannot sustain solved quarantining old nothing else e lockdown travel ban anything quarantining old covid 19 apparently harm young really sound solution

AskIndia,do you think india should revoke lockdown on april 14 ?,63,fwm5c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwm5c3/do_you_think_india_should_revoke_lockdown_on/,33,2020-04-08 04:40:23,"personally, i believe that our corona virus cases would increase exponentially after april 14 if lockdown is revoked.

* india‚Äôs current total infected cases is 4,900 and we are testing about 12,000 people per day. which i think is nowhere near enough. 

* united states had around 5000 cases before march 20 and they were testing around 50,000 per day during that time, they increased it to about 1,10,000 testing per day on march 25 and their corona virus cases started exploding.

even if we‚Äôre on lockdown, plenty of incidents happened recently that might have caused mass community spreading like the nizamuddin dargah, hundreds of people celebrating ram navmi despite lockdown, dharavi slum incident, then those mass-migrations just after lockdown, and on april 5 too, almost everywhere (from big cities to small towns) people started celebrating like it‚Äôs diwali... so, if these incidents caused tons of new cases, then they‚Äôd mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over, and it‚Äôd started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown. 

also if we continue with these very low rates of testings, we‚Äôll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve. may sources also claimed india will peak the epidemic around april first week, which is far from truth. but according to speculations from artificial intelligence, india will peak during june-july..",Smooth_Guidance,yes agree lockdown got wasted imo instead clapping lighting diya power focused pushed getting ppes docs getting testing kits start testing time likely scenario extend lockdown mean understand logistics manufacturing hit getting kits ppes bit task governments world still considering population lockdown priority specially metro cities population density high places businesses are clean big cities start economy engine first,218,11,5.1863636363636365,4.090909090909091,think revoke lockdown april 14 personally believe corona virus cases would increase exponentially april 14 lockdown revoked current total infected cases 4 900 testing 12 000 per day think nowhere near enough united states around 5000 cases march 20 testing around 50 000 per day time increased 1 10 000 testing per day march 25 corona virus cases started exploding even we re lockdown plenty incidents happened recently might caused mass community spreading nizamuddin dargah hundreds celebrating ram navmi despite lockdown dharavi slum incident mass migrations lockdown april 5 too almost everywhere from big cities small towns started celebrating diwali so incidents caused tons new cases they d mostly show symptoms lockdown over d started disastrous community spreading lockdown continue low rates testings we ll never able figure peak curve may sources claimed peak epidemic around april first week far truth according speculations artificial intelligence peak june july

but why do most of us choose to work at jobs instead of taking risks by doing something else like a start-up or taking jobs with high risk? i am not saying that working at a 9-5 job is bad, but atleast some good percentage of us should have been risk takers, right?

in my opinion the reason why americans are more successful is because they take huge risks and they either payoff or they fail and they go in debt. we should be able to take risks because even if they fail most of our parents are happy to bail us out compared to the western parents. 

please note that i am not judging anyone who works at a no risk job. i was just wondering why as a country we all do this. i also understand that the risk taking culture has improved in the past few years.

i will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. if someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. he can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day.

AskIndia,women in india with 31 fingers called a witch throughout her life.,580,fjj42g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjj42g/women_in_india_with_31_fingers_called_a_witch/,36,2020-03-17 00:25:16,"life becomes unbearable without the love and affection of the family members and the belongingness of society. unfortunately for kumarinayak, a 63-year-old woman from the ganjan district of odisha, her life has been a humiliation because she has polydactylism.

&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/se8pqngcm0n41.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a05d1d9821b72ee428b88ec5d46e8bd0b2a717b

polydactylism is a defect in the body where the person suffers from abnormal growth. in the case of kumari, she was born with 19 toes and 12 fingers by birth. her life was made miserable by this disease as, since childhood, people used to keep their children away from her and call her names.¬†

kumari said in an interview: ‚Äòi was born with this defect and i couldn‚Äôt be treated as we belonged to a low-income family. ‚Äò

as she grew old, things turned even worse as she was called a witch by her neighbors. she feels terrible by such remarks but is helpless as she cannot get herself treated and can‚Äôt fight a long battle with superstitions. therefore, she keeps herself indoor to avoid bitter words.

it has now been 63 years that i have had this condition. she said in the interview, ‚Äòthe residents nearby, who are too much into blind faiths, believe that i am a witch and keep away from me. they sometimes come to see my condition ‚Äì but never help. ‚Äòi am forced to stay indoors as i am being treated differently, which is not a nice way of treatment from my neighbors.‚Äô

one of her neighbors, who understands the medical condition of kumari, often comes to help her, but even she said that the mentality of people in a small village is such that they think of everything in terms of good or bad, god-like or witch. and, kumari‚Äôs medical condition has made her the witch of the village.

on hearing kumari‚Äôs situation, government officials of india have decided to come to her aid. she is granted a house and monthly pension so that she can live a life of dignity. even measures are taken to stop murders of women in the pretext of witch-hunting and black magic.

in 2016, there were 135 cases registered of murder and lynch mobbing to curb black magic. even though the government of india is taking measures to curb such heinous acts, but the administration feels the efforts on the ground level are not adequate, and mass awareness needs to be spread about such diseases.¬†

let's hope stricter laws are passes, and victims of such diseases are also considered humans and give their share of respect in society.¬†

it made me wonder about all the apps and businesses that don't get enough attention and support. 

what are some of the apps that you think people should know about? what does it do? does it solve a problem in society?

please don't recommend any dating apps.

i don't know how to explain this feeling but for the past couple of days (7-10maybe) i have been very down , depressed , my heart aches daily like there's a hand grabbing my heart pressing it what not and i have even cried a lot before going to sleep ( silently although i wanted to shout at the top of my head but couldn't as it would wake my parents ) 

what i am trying to say maybe is that i am currently feeling as if i don't know anything about animation be it 2d or 3d ..everyday i keep on practicing and learning and try to do my best but it never feels enough and i am worried sick what will i do after i graduate ( i am in my 2nd year if college ) 

the thing is i am self taught because i failed my nid and dufa exam mainly because i have been practicing art digitally since i was in 9-10th standard or so and the exams where in traditional medium my dad asked if i wanted to go for a private uni for arts but i declined the offer because i was told by a couple of people and professional that it's pretty much useless and i chose one of the easiest course in du in the hopes that i will have a lot of free time to teach myself and spare money to buy equipment if necessary (my fee is only 27000 for 3years)  both of these things came true i do have a a lot of time and my fee is not much .

i knew this was a risky move getting into a course that's not related to animation ( it is, if u thing of it as a business because i do want to have my own studio and it does kinda help ) and i believed a lot in myself that i will do good but apparently i haven't ! as much as i want to tell my parents that i am scared as to what i would do in the future, i just can't because it won't help me and would only stress them because they will start worrying and it's not like they know anything about animation and would start making calls for knowledge and help ..i don't want to give them that kind of a stress right now .

i should also mention this i do plan to do a 6 month diploma on animation and fine arts after i graduate respectively 

the reason i made this post is because i wanted to let go of this feeling just let me out. and get a good couple of advice from people who are in the animation industry as to how it works and stuff and get in touch with them , get some advice from people to resolve this feeling and most importantly to find myself a mentor who couple give me tasks to do this and that either weekly or monthly and later review my works and broadly point my mistakes and give me some direction 

all the hard-work would come from me but i need someone to guide me ! youtube videos would never point out my mistake and i need someone to i guess

i will link my best works at the end.

i have figured i work best when someone gives me deadline to work with. i just need someone to tell me who actually has knowledge to from either school or industry to give me assignment and nothing more i will find what that things means etc etc and just review my work at the end .

i beg you if you thing you have that kind of knowledge and can spare 30-40min a week or a month please help this stranger ( i told my name in the beginning because i believe one stops thing of you as a complete stranger if they know your name ) 

you don't even have to give me your phone number or email address we can talk directly on reddit message or instagram or facebook or any other app that you might thing is comfortable ( in case this message looks like a scam) 

but i beg you if you can spare a couple of minutes a week or a month to help me please do although i don't have anything to give in return but i would be ever grateful for your help.

please help me if you can.

AskIndia,although rape is a serious problem in our country that needs to stop. there is another problem of false rape accusations that nobody seems to wanna talk about.,56,fleoe8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fleoe8/although_rape_is_a_serious_problem_in_our_country/,53,2020-03-20 07:40:11,"before i start, i'd like to make it clear that i do believe rape is a heinous crime and there should be severe punishments for those who commit it. having said that, shouldn't someone who is innocent also getting the same punishment and being discarded by society be talked about too? what about the woman who made up the story, shouldn't she be punished for ruining someone's life? 

according to the national crime records bureau, a total of 38,947 rape cases were reported in india in 2016. in 10,068 cases ‚Äì about a quarter ‚Äì the women claimed it was rape on the false promise of marriage. in andhra pradesh state, 45% of all rape cases filed in the past two years fell into the false marriage category. just think about that, every 1 in 3 is an innocent man, and in andra pradesh, that's 1 in 2 where for every 2 rape accusations an innocent man's life is ruined.

it's sad because rape is a very sensitive subject which people avoid talking about and these problems are still happening every day. i'm tired of hearing every other country saying that our country is the rape capital of the world and no one if only a few dares to talk about false accusations.

however, father has been abusive and manipulative to her and she has put up with it because of indian society, chaar log kya kahenge bla bla. i hadn't recognised this before or tried to ignore it thinking it will be ok later and also i stay away from them since i work in a faraway city and visit them once in a while.  this time due to corona effect i had to travel since i stay alone and can't cook for shit.

today morning again he started with his bullshit about some silly reason to her and i couldn't hold any longer and got into an argument with him to defend her. the shouting match prevailed and neighbour could hear us. after this, i realized that this is not good so i sat and tried to reason with him for almost three hours and also apologised for shouting at him. but he got only defensive and never discussed his actual feeling out but instead started blaming me and my mother about everything. it's strange that he doesn't even recognize that it is her and to some extent my hard work that is putting the food on the table.

telling my father is going to be a whole other event. he cares even more deeply about the caste, can be counted on to always have an emotional reaction than a reasonable one. logic almost always eludes him. i'm actually worried about his blood pressure when i break this to him. the hypocrisy is strong because i found out about his affair, but that has conveniently been forgotten. i don't want to use that as ammo but might have to if it gets out of hand.also, my relatives are pieces of shit. my brother lives in the us and had a inter-caste marriage himself, but they use that for ""he has done this to us already, you can't do this as well. we'll become the laughing stock of the family"" my brother has done his bit by trying to talk to mom and is supportive, but that's doesn't seem to be helping.

AskIndia,what are your thoughts on arranged marriage? and marrying someone with history of mental illness?,16,g06aaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g06aaf/what_are_your_thoughts_on_arranged_marriage_and/,12,2020-04-13 12:00:59,"i think that it is very important that a person reveals about their physical and mental health issues before marriage. otherwise it will essentially be lying / withholding information.

most of my friends married without revealing their struggles. i am talking about both male and female friends, from big cities and towns as well.

obviously i don't know where they will be five or ten years from now. but as of now things seem to be going well.

obviously i don't really know what exactly is going on in their personal lives.

the mental struggles do manifest although, and could be kept hidden for only so long.

i believe that some illnesses although are more severe than others, especially those illnesses that require antipsychotic medicines. as they can cause sexual dysfunction - erectile dysfunction.

so this could severely impact the quality of sex life of the couple. 

other than that the mental struggles tend to be genetic. so the offspring is likely to have some positive or negative abnormalities. but it could be really positive too, as relatives of people with mental health issues can often be high achievers as well.

i myself have lived a life of honesty, so i never hide. although people are quick to assume about the severity of the illness. and they being to imagine dramatic images of people who struggle with these illness.

so, it tends to become a conflict of interest.

so some people decide to keep things to themselves, because others might exaggerate for fun. and it might lead to them being ostracized. 

i personally am not a big fan of marriage or seeking companionship etc although i want to conform with the social norms to some degree. and there always is interest of family members as well.

please help me ... if any one here is a psychiatrist or in this field .. please advise me on what to do 


it started a few days ago , i was fine and doing well until i watched a movie about someone being falsely accused , i got intrusive thoughts that i might get falsely accused too , and my fear was escalated when i realised that i have a pretty suspicious post history on reddit and search history too , so i got really scared that i'd be falsely accused , so i did a few google searches about weather or not i'm being tracked by the government or not , and it came with scary search results so my intrusive thoughts shifted to being spied on and falsely accused at the same time , now i don't have a lot of friends but i really value the few friends i have so i was scared that this would hurt my reputation and i would lose my current friends and not be able to make new friends either .. then later on i got so anxious and thought ""what if i am actually a criminal ? the idea didn't bother me at first but then i googled ""surpressed memories"" and i got pretty scared as well , and had the thought that i might be actually a horrible criminal and have surpressed memories of it because i cant remember doing anything bad .... i had additional intrusive thoughts as well like this world being a hallucination and that maybe in reality i'm doing some terrible things .... i was extremely scared and had a lot of anxiety ... then later on it shifted to my current fear .. that is going to *** .... this fear is based on a dream i had a few months ago i had a dream that my life would crumble down.... and that i'd be rejected by everyone and that i'd never reach my loved ones .... i was really going through panic in my dream ... and was contemplating suicide or drugs too .... there was a figure in that dream that resembled ryuk from the anime death note ... who was mocking me about my fate.....right now i feel similar to that dream ..... but i have reasons to believe that this might be true because i've been noticing various signs like scary typos while typing and ads with specific wordings etc and events like me bringing a new charger and it not working afterwords ... and me having to lay down in a specific position so it charges while using it ... having to eat bad food etc and my mom acting weird i saw two other anime called hell girl and babylon which scared me too ... because both plots resemble what i'm going through i'm really anxious at this point and don't know what to do .... i'm scared and always have a feeling like i'm being watched .... i even thought to myself that if i wear this specific clothing then something scary would happen and well ... i saw the hell girl cast and had a ""hallucination"" of making a deal with the devil .. or taking a loan from a hell bank now i'm scared of going to a bank or taking out a loan i was interested in anime and now i'm scared of it .... i was interested in banking stuff and now i'm scared .... even now i'm witnessing scary typos too .... i don't know what to do... one reason i'm scared of getting help is because ... i think that if i let my guard down or feel relieved ... something terrible would happen ... and in babylon ... help from nowhere worked for the protagonist almost .... this seems similar to me .. and i'm scared of it and hope it's not .... 


even now i'm witnessing scary signs like word suggestions , scary co incidences , someone with the username ""naively idealistic"" messaged me with kind words ... this seemed like a supernatural warning .... one thing i forgot to mention is that a main character in hell girl three vessels saw her ambitions crumble and her succeeding the hellgirl .... i don't want this to happen with me ..

fuck i'm even having scary medical symptoms  and disturbing  typos and  signs as if telling me to not talk about this .... .. this all seems so scary and frightening ... i'm really scared please help me

edit : it seems to keep on getting scarier ...


edit : i'm scared of feeling even slightly relieved or talking about this because im scared of its  repucussions if any.. it's really frightening ..

edit : i felt a strong earthquake that seems like only i felt , idk what this was .... now i'm really scared even more ...

edit : just remembered that there was another character in hellgirl who was accused of something and sent to hell , don't know if falsely or not ... now i'm even more scared..

edit : since i seem to be more concerned about being accused... and at times i'm not much anxious.... i'm really scared.... fuck ... i am more scared about being accused ... i don't know .... what if i appeared like a manipulator or appeared normal to a psychiatrist ?.... 

edit : what if i'm looking like one right now ? please .... i'm suffering .... i'm not lying about being anxious ...

edit : more scary signs and scary thoughts ... for example ""i'm going"" and ""i'm goin"" was in a text bar ... and my phone discharged too ... and some scary  warning etc  kind of typos ..... even when typing now ( oof more typos) and non typos in some sentences .. even now scary signs

edit : the earthquake was in delhi  my area 
.... the epicenter too .... which is scary ... inmany ways

edit : many of the themes in that anime seem really scary and similar .... like regret etc ....and people sending others to hell but realising their mistakes since they go to hell too .... by doing so... and other situations leading to them regretting their decisions .... i'm getting so many scary typos and signs while typing this ...

edit : i had  a dream when i was sleeping recently about being a big criminal on the run ... and i had a dream about reading about hellgirl on wikipedia and how disturbing it is and hell is , i had a negative dream again wearing the same sheet ... that i wore when i had my previous negative dreams .... it's so frightening .... and i had so many scary typos typing this.... edit of this edit : the typos were really scary like warnings even now i think 


edit : i'm still seeing scary signs etc .... for example a sinister smile shape in a cup of tea etc .... i'm really scared .... im scared that maybe   innocent people can be sent to hell too.  

edit : i saw something related to the thing i think i should have avoided .... related to banking kind of ... and i'm scared i made the wrong decision by doing so maybe ... even my phone discharged before .... for many minutes .... im  scared that maybe this is a pattern or symbolic or manipulated ...

edit : still witnessing scary signs

edit : the second previous edit is scaring me ... i'm scared that maybe i shouldn't have seen stuff related to banking ... because it seems so symbolic and patterned

edit : i remember being really jelous of my cousin ... and hating him ... in hell girl you can send people to hell like i said .... i don't want to be in that situation .... i have an ambition that i'm afraid of having crumbled ..... i'm unable to put it in words right now and that's what scares me because of the repucutions if any ... of it ... i'm having negative thoughts of my close people betraying me ..... or looking like they betrayed me or crumbling my ambition ... and i doing something terrible like sending them to hell .... and going to hell as well .... i'm seriously scared ..... 

edit : i even had scary medical symptoms again ....
 

edit : i'm sorry to everyone who i've wished hell and anything bad on .... i'm sorry ..... 

edit : i tried to copy paste this to 7 cups forums but it didn't work.... i wonder what it could mean 

edit : i saw some things ..
 that i'm scared of there .... now i'm scared ... i don't even wanna talk about it but i'm scared that this means something and might have repucutions ....

our college officials can barely run a college properly and most of us reckon that this is going to end in a massive disaster where many of us loose our belongings.

all of this decision was taken without any prior notice. not even a slightest hint. most of were informed by word of mouth by our college mates.

i respect that our college is taking initiative and helping in this tough time but this isn't the way.

some of the colleges got an order from dm to convert the hostel into an isolation ward but our college isn't required to convert hostel rooms into isolation ward because we didn't receive any notice.

issue is, it's kinda hard to be alone all the time. but i also don't want to change because frankly, people never change. 

i am also a danger to people around me so even my mom agrees to an extent that it might be good that no girls even like looking at me much less like me. so, despite her lifelong wish of seeing me married someday, some part of her doesn't want to get me married. 

plus even if i did get married i don't want kids. and since this is india and not some western country, almost zero women would want a childfree life.


anyway, tldr is that it's probably better for me and people around me that i spend my life alone, but at times i just can't take the fact that i don't have a girlfriend or even friends to talk to.

so how do i strengthen my mind so that i don't feel lonely or bad about any physical needs and stuffs. i just want to shut off the world and my own sexual desires completely so that my mind can be freed a bit.

AskIndia,is upi becoming unreliable?,74,fd7v8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fd7v8a/is_upi_becoming_unreliable/,63,2020-03-04 18:18:26,"i've always held upi as one of the most impactful technology that had been implemented in india over the last few years. the simplified payment system has made transactions simpler and much easier to execute and track, and me along with most of my friends, colleagues and even my parents have started using it for day to day transactions.

but recently, the entire platform is behaving very erratically. and while the problems used to happen to banks earlier, now it's effecting individual apps as well. below are a few observations from the last few months:


1. more often than not, upi transactions are failing to complete. sometimes the money is getting debited, and then the status stays pending. other times, the money isn't debited. but in both cases, the payment is not being made. and as a user, i've no visibility where my money is.


2. at times the beneficiary isn't getting the money or the sms immediately, and although the payment is a success at my end, the beneficiary is refusing to accept the payment because he can't track.


3. individual apps are becoming unreliable, especially google pay. the transactions take much longer to complete than other apps (paytm is faster, and samsung pay upi for some reason is the fastest). it's a bit difficult to point the finger towards the app (google pay) because scaling shouldn't be a problem with them. 


4. inconsistent failures are also happening. when google pay is saying bank server not available, paytm got the transaction through. which didn't happen earlier as my own bank server going down affected all apps equally. now a days, it's difficult to predict where or how the failure is taking place.


overall, the platform is slowly becoming very very unreliable for larger transactions. there's no accountability, and during such problems, the source bank asks you to contact the destination bank, and the destination bank will point a finger to the source bank. and most of the apps do not have good customer service (no live support), so i've to shoot mails and call up each bank, then talk to the customer care of the service where i was making the payment (say, yatra), and since there's zero coordination, the transaction remains hanging in the air.

now, to be fair to npci, i've never actually lost money because of such failures. if the payment doesn't go through, i'll get the refund in anywhere between 1-5 days. but this doesn't solve my problem. the transaction is still a failure and i've lost my service.


after losing out on flight tickets, credit card payments and hotel bookings multiple times, i've stopped using upi for any transactions over 1000 rupees. now i'm trying to get my landlord to take payment through netbanking. i've switched back to cards and safe to say, they are performing just as good as they were when upi got implemented. 


so my question is, are you all facing similar problems as well? is upi still as reliable as it used to be?

i am working for my current company for almost 1 year now. 2 weeks ago, i put in my resignation because i got a much better job at another company. however, since we have to serve a 2 month notice period, i'm still here for 6 more weeks.

anyway, ever since i put in my notice, management has been watching me like a hawk. they've assigned me work that's way beyond my paygrade and stuff that i clearly cannot do. since i had resigned, i was feeling very carefree, and left 2 hours early on friday without notifying anyone. but this is a pretty regular happening in my company on fridays. anyway, i got a super passive aggressive email from my boss about that last night, even though this wasn't a problem in the past year when i left slightly early.

i talked to a friend who had left a few months back and he essentially told me management at the company is very vindictive and the same stuff was done to him. apparently he had to fight tooth and nail to not get terminated while on notice.

now, i don't really care if i do get fired, i have another job lined up after all. what really scares me is that the other company's offer is at least in some part based on a background check, of which my current company's service letter (or some call it experience letter) is a part of. that is, i don't want them looking at the service letter and it says ""employee was terminated"" because that'll look bad. same if they call up my current company.

so what exactly is written on a service letter? just the position, start date and end date? or does it also mention your performance or if you were terminated? and if a company calls another company to make sure you were working there, will the previous company mention that you were fired, or simply confirm whether you were working or not?

on 13th december 1971, us president nixon redirected the 7th navy fleet led by the 75,000 ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier uss enterprise, the most powerful warship in the world at that time, to go to the bay of bengal to stop india from liberating bangladesh

indian prime minister indira gandhi promptly called on moscow to invoke a secret provision in the india-soviety treaty under which russia was bound to defend india in case of any external aggression. russia sent a nuclear armed flotilla including a nuclear submarine from vladivostok on 13th december, 1971 under the command of admiral vladimir kuroyedov, who has orders not to allow the us fleet to advance and attack the military bases of india. 

the only thing standing between the us fleet and the indian cities was the indian aircraft carrier ins vikrant and the russian fleet, so india and russia came up with a crafty plan to stop them. 

as the us aircraft carrier was entering the bay of bengal to attack india, for the first time in human history the russians decided to intentionally bring their nuclear submarine to the surface and let the americans see them.

as soon as the russian submarine surfaced on the bay of bengal, the us admiral lost all hope and made the following quote 'we are too late, the russians are already here'
the mere fact of seeing russian nuclear warheads in the bay of bengal changed america's mind and they retreated.

russia further went on to say 'a war on india will be considered a war on russia' and threatened china to not join the conflict on orders of the us and threatened to sink sinkiang (a region in china) if they tried to stop india from liberating bangladesh.

ever since then india has considered russia as their most trusted ally in the world and is now the largest importer of russian weapons and nuclear reactors in the world.

Non-Political,101 years of jallianwala bagh massacre | background | aftermath | shaheed uddham singh [mega thread],256,g0dofi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g0dofi/101_years_of_jallianwala_bagh_massacre_background/,52,2020-04-13 20:14:55,"***\*picture thread attached at the bottom, please read before you check it, i've tried to keep it as short yet detailed as possible\****

the **jallianwala bagh massacre**, also known as the **amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 april 1919, when acting brigadier-general reginald dyer ordered troops of the british indian army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed indian civilians in jallianwala bagh, amritsar, punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. over 1,000 people were injured.

some facts about the jallianwala bagh massacre:

1. the precursor to the massacre was the rowlatt act. this act was passed in february 1919.
2. the rowlatt act gave the british government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. the rowlatt act was basically designed for controlling activities of indian revolutionaries.
4. protesting against the act, the indians observed a hartal on march 30th and april 6th of 1919.
5. on april 10, 1919, two famous leaders, dr. kitchlew and dr. satyapal were arrested on the basis of the rowlatt act.
6. two days later on the 12th of april, 1919, general dyer took command of troops. he issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. the gathering had no political intent at all. it was meant for celebrating baisakhi ‚Äì the sikh festival.
9. anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at jallianwala bagh on the evening of that day.
10. the gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating baisakhi.
11. though the festival was a sikh festival, many hindus and muslims also came to celebrate the same. all of them were there for commemorating the day when khalsa panth was founded by guru gobind singh.
12. apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. this is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. apart from gurkha and  baluchi soldiers using scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. according to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before colonel dyer ordered the firing.
15. the firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. the shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent british actions spread throughout the subcontinent. the bengali poet and nobel laureate rabindranath tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920‚Äì22), which thrust him to prominence in the indian nationalist struggle.
19. dyer was initially lauded for his actions in britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [british raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_raj) such as members of the [house of lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_lords). he was, however, widely criticised in the [house of commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_commons), whose july 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. the government of india ordered an investigation of the incident (the hunter commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. the last known survivor of the jallianwala bagh massacre, shingara singh, died in amritsar on june 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. the british government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in india and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in britain until december 1919.
23. this event caused many moderate indians to abandon their loyalty to the  british and become nationalists distrustful of the british
24. colonel dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which major general william beynon replied:  ""your action correct and lieutenant governor approves
25. both [secretary of state for war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_of_state_for_war) [winston churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winston_churchill) and former prime minister [h. h. asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h._h._asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. winston churchill, in the house of commons debate of 8 july 1920, said,  ""the crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. it was not attacking anybody or anything‚Ä¶ when the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than trafalgar square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. when the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. the fire was then directed to the sides.  many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. this was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. after churchill's speech in the house of commons debate, mps voted 247 to 37 against dyer and in support of the government.
28. the general dyer-led massacre at amritsar‚Äôs jalianwalla bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of indians.
29. colonel michael o'dwyer was shot dead on 13 march, 1940, by a man named udham singh, a member of the revolutionist ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  jallianwala bagh massacre.
30. the casualty number estimated by the indian national congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. indian nationalist [swami shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swami_shraddhanand) wrote to gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# shaheed uddham singh

1. **shaheed udham singh** (26 december 1899 ‚Äì 31 july 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the ghadar party best known for his  assassination in london of michael o'dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of punjab in india, on 13 march 1940
2.  while in custody, he used the name **ram mohammad singh azad**, which represents the three major religions of punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. shaheed uddham singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of punjab province, general  michael o'dyer.
4. while awaiting his trial, singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. on 4 june 1940
5. when asked about his motivation, singh explained:

>i did it because i had a grudge against him. he deserved  it. he was the real culprit. he wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so i have crushed him. for full 21 years, i have been trying to  seek vengeance. i am happy that i have done the job. i am not scared of  death. i am dying for my country.  i have seen my people starving in  india under the british rule. i have protested against this, it was my  duty. what greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. on 31 july 1940, singh was hanged at [pentonville prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pentonville_prison).

# following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] however, political activists who had set up the shaheed udham singh trust and working with the indian workers association (gb), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

he started the speech with a denunciation of british imperialism:

>""i say down with british imperialism. you say india do not have peace. we have only slavery generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  all you have to do is read your own history. if you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. the brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>at this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""i do not care about the sentence of death. it means nothing at all.  i do not care about dying or anything. i do not worry about it at all. i  am dying for a purpose.‚Äô thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‚Äòwe are suffering from the british empire.‚Äô udham singh continued more quietly. ‚Äòi am not afraid to die. i am proud to die, to have to free my native land and i hope that when i am gone, i hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""i am standing before an english jury. i am in an english court.  you people go to india and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the house of commons. we come to england and we are sentenced to  death.‚Äô  
>  
>""i never meant anything, but i will take it. i do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to india there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of india. all your british imperialism  will be smashed.‚Äô ""machine guns on the streets of india mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  christianity flies.‚Äô  
>  
>""your conduct, your conduct ‚Äì i am talking about the british government. i have nothing against the english people at all. i have more english friends living in england than i have in india. i have great sympathy with the workers of england. i am against the imperialist  government.‚Äô  
>  
>""you people are suffering ‚Äì workers. everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. india is only slavery.  killing, mutilating and destroying ‚Äì british imperialism. people do not read about it in the papers. we know what is going on in india.""  
>  
>at this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but singh continued:  
>  
>""you ask me what i have to say. i am saying it. because you people are dirty. you do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  india.  
>  
>he then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'down with british imperialism! down with british dirty dogs!""  
>  
>he turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor‚Äôs table.

&#x200b;

his remains are preserved at the jallianwala bagh in amritsar, punjab.  on every 31 july, marches are held in sunam by various organizations and every statue of singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

there are offices where senior managers harass / shout at juniors, there are colleges where senior students rag juniors, there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so on.

in many of the cases, i have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors. many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. do you see the problem here? - this cycle is never going to stop. one able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.

so here is my request - break the chain. try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. when you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids). this will slowly start to have impact and i am hopeful people will get healthier work environments. remember that indians are very low in the happiness index list, and with small efforts from our side, we can improve.",aaluinsonaout,want agree said younger folk treating low profile jobs better unfortunately seems big majority wants perceived educated comes barely literate,242,7,4.467213114754099,4.285714285714286,polite request indians know situation countries seen lot organisations toxic environments offices senior managers harass shout juniors colleges senior students rag juniors school teachers make fun students good studies on many cases seen seniors harass juniors harassed past seniors many managers pick habit shouting juniors shouted too juniors see problem here cycle never going stop able person harass another person harass someone else keep continuing request break chain try polite especially juniors around you try vent frustration maid shout her may reply you definitely going shout someone else day vent frustration perhaps might shout kids slowly start impact hopeful healthier work environments remember indians low happiness index list small efforts side improve

most people that i have seen buying car are the ones spending their entire year salary's equivalent sum of money buying something they don't really need. some people even spend amount equivalent to their two year's salary on a depreciation asset like car.

i ran numbers in different ways and realised that it's not worth the price you pay. i also found a specific kilometre number (kind of like break even for car usage) if you drive above it annually then it makes sense to go for car otherwise not.

it's easy to get a car when going out with friends or family (zoomcar etc) if you need to commute to office then two wheeler or cabs or autos are sufficient that's what i feel.

i completely understand some people buy car for reasons like status in society, comfort etc. by no means am against them, just sharing what i think.

as the news of the epidemic becoming severe, i decided to go back to bangalore,india.

this is where the fun starts:
- on february 6, i land in bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am i coming from and i say bali and he let‚Äôs me go. (no temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn‚Äôt check my travel/visa history at all and i had to report myself that i live in china, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to china after jan 24

a week later i have a bad cold (i have a weak immunity) and since i have a crazy travel history and didn‚Äôt want to take risk and endanger people, so i call the helpline and they ask me if i spoke any hindi (i didn‚Äôt) and they disconnected..
so i went to the official government center (rajiv gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
the staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest x-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.so i was isolated and quarantined.

my family were not happy that i reported myself and the hospital ‚Äòheld‚Äô me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‚Äònegative‚Äô for the virus.

the quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
i was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you‚Äôre away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
it was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since i live in a joint family here in blr.

tldr; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative

now, it's full of hate speech, low-quality answers and cringeworthy questions like - ""what are some destruction level 100 tweets"" or ""what are some badass tweets during covid-19"". it's filled with young indians who have zero knowledge about the topic but don't hesitate to write their senseless opinions and comment hate. 

what's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. there are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-hindus and liberals in almost every problem. 

my personal experience : 1) a guy literally wrote an answer saying italians are victims of coronavirus because they are liberals. a commentor on same answer even wrote that italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". both of them were indians.

2) many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) one guy literally posted tweets from bjp trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'. 

4)  multiple answers ""completely"" blaming muslims for coronavirus ( tablighi jamaat should be blamed 100% but not the whole religion )

when they're not engrossed by their loud pujas, however, i can hear them yell at each other - all day long. they call each other names to the extent that'd make a road rag blush. nobody in our building, therefore, likes them one bit - they're a nuisance not only to each other, but to other families in the building too, many of whom have impressionable little children.

this made me think - what's the point of following any religion if it doesn't bring you an iota of peace or doesn't rid you of basic vices of jealousy, intolerance, harm to the fellow human, and lack of empathy in general? what would the cosmetic practice of religious rituals achieve in the long run if you are a progressively worse human being with every passing day?

Non-Political,i realised (definitely just a bit of it) yesterday how creepy we indian men are .,231,filcke,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/filcke/i_realised_definitely_just_a_bit_of_it_yesterday/,121,2020-03-15 06:20:01,"this happened yesterday morning. i use a bicycle to travel to work. so en-route as i reached one of the traffic lights, there was this guy on some 4-5 year old splender idling his bike on zebra crossing.

i stopped some 1/2 feet  before zebra crossing. now we we were the only two guys on that side. some 15 seconds later a girl on activa stops next to me before zebra crossings.

now this guy starts revving up his engine and started looking back towards his silencer as if checking that there is something wrong with his bike. there was nothing wrong - no black or white smoke. he was just checking out the girl. then this guy slowly started reversing his bike and placed it before the zebra crossing between me and that girl and kept revving his bike for other 20 sec till lights turned green. 

whille he was reversing and revving i had a feeling that he was doing this as a show-off. the girl and i happened to look at each other and her expression seemed to say ""yes i know what he is doing"" as if reading my mind.

as the light turned green they happen to turn in different directions and that guy might have followed her if they were going the same way, i relaxed a bit but it creeped me out.

i will not try to be holier than thou. i also checkout girls and i am sure girls also checkout boys - which is normal. but i do that very discreetly and never have been the one indulging in catcalling or someone who stares till the girl disappears in the crowd or ""ghar tak chod kar ayenge"" types.

it is normal to checkout individuals from opposite gender but catcalling and staring to make other person uncomfortable is not.

we indian men need to understand this.


edit 1:

seems like this post has divided opinions.

a) some people are shouting out about this post being generalising for all indian men.

i want to make it very clear -

i pointed out the issue and not singled out the person.

 when i used the term ""indian men"" i was referring to those who indulge in such attention seeking gimmicks. and if you do not do that i didn't call you out.

and if you are not satisfied now, then come let's nitpick the skin from hair. 

b) there are others who are taking the side of the other guy and are pointing out that it may just have been an issue with his bike.

which is a fair point. but is based on presumption.
and for that i would say two things:


        1) i develop engines and can tell you if something is wrong with the engine. i am very sure everything was fine with that bike.



        2) this happened in chandigarh and if you have a idea about gedi culture here you will know what such signals are meant for. and i know what that meant

c) lastly, those who understood this thanks for trying to reason with others

**edit 2:**

this is getting out of hand

**to all the not all men brigade**


hear me out and answer this honestly to  yourself (do not post here if your ego hurts).
whenever you go out with your girlfriend, sister or any female relative of yours don't you always have to look out for male leching?

if you do not then you are living in a really good place my friend. but if you do that ,then what you are assuming is that all men will want to look at them. you yourself think that sub-consciously that ""all men will do this"".

i recently found out from his whatsapp photo that it wasn‚Äôt true at all‚Ä¶in reality he just got married, and he's still working in the states. i have not attempted to contact nor confront him since before he dumped me via text message -- his text was the last piece of communication between us.

even after making 40l last year, these rates are just absurd to me. yet, every new development coming up around me is 4-5cr minimum.

who is buying all this property? and why is it there such a massive discrepancy between rent and sale value? in most cases, even with a generous downpayment, rent is 25-30% of monthly emi.

Non-Political,the narrative structure of a whatsapp forward,317,fnh884,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnh884/the_narrative_structure_of_a_whatsapp_forward/,52,2020-03-23 23:09:26,"with a global pandemic on full swing and lockdown on many cities of the nation, i, like most citizens, have locked myself behind the doors of my house.
with so much time on my hand, thanks to quarantine, i started reading numerous whatsapp forwards to entertain myself. these messages contained a trove of erroneous information but were so hilarious i overlooked them. 


soon, i started noticing similarities in these messages. so, i decided to find out what ingredients these messages use and are there any underlying structure for these messages.


after reading, analysing, and breaking down a lot of such messages, here‚Äôs what i found:


**these messages contain**:


1)	 appeal to the reader‚Äôs pride in national and cultural heritage:    
> a very important reason these forwards work is the emotional appeal in them. the messages implore the readers by using words like ‚Äòcountrywide efforts‚Äô, ‚Äòmentioned in puranas/vedas‚Äô, ‚Äòproud to be an indian‚Äô,  etc.


2) 	claims supported by a prestigious scientific organisation, astrological events, or philosophical reasoning:    
> your mentions of nasa, unesco, who, etc. come here. but these are not alone. mentions of astrological events like amavasya, poornima, the position of planets and stars, etc. also find their way in such messages.    
> it is a very simple trick to make an unsuspecting reader trust the information in the message.


3)	 use of first-person plural pronouns:    
> plenty of these messages are written in first-person plural pronouns. it is an easy trick to allow the reader to connect with the emotions behind the message because of the first-person pronouns and plural ‚Äòwe‚Äô or ‚Äòus‚Äô gives the reader a sense of belonging. the reader feels that they are not alone and are a part of a group.


4)	 the germinal idea:    
> the most important thing in the message is the ‚Äògerminal idea‚Äô. it is the information the message has to spread. the idea is worded simply and can be summed up easily.


5)	 lastly, emojis of the indian flag, namaste, aum, etc. also crop up in these messages from time to time.


**the narrative structure**:    


now that i knew the ingredients these messages employ, i moved on to understand the way they appeared in the message. was there a formula to structure the above-mentioned ingredients into a cohesive message? i decided to use the popular ‚Äòrule of 3‚Äô to understand the structure.


the message is, usually, divided into three parts ‚Äòthe hook‚Äô, ‚Äòthe butter‚Äô, and ‚Äòthe noose‚Äô.


**part 1 - the hook**:    
the reader may have a very small attention span, and so the message has to hook them early on. this is usually done with an interesting statement to communicate the germinal idea, but sometimes the names of scientific institutions like nasa, unesco, etc. can act as the hook too.    
not everyone will read the complete text message and therefore the germinal idea has to appear as early as possible.


**part 2 - the butter**:    
although, the reader is hooked and the germinal idea is communicated, but the chances that the reader is completely sold on the idea is very low.    
therefore, the butter provides the message with a credulity. this is done by mentioning the names of various institutions, person, equipment, or astrological events.    
this part of the message is worded to sound like facts but are usually false.


**part 3 - the noose**:    
the reader may have bought the facts mentioned in part 2, but the message needs their blind faith. so, the message now ties a noose around the readers by appealing to their emotions.    
this can be done by using one's pride in nation, culture, history, or religion. this part plays a fairly important role because emotions are powerful enough override to logical decisions.

i ask because although i‚Äôm 30 years old and my high school years are a thousand years behind me, i‚Äôve always believed that part of the reason i used to get picked on and bullied by my peers in my teens so much is because they noticed how much certain teachers would pick on me and since children are impressionable, they thought it was ok to do the same. i think teachers saw me as an 'easy target' and got some of rush out of bullying me.

children follow by example. if adults bully, children will do the same.

there have been so many instances of teachers simply acting unprofessional and mentally unstable when there is no reason to. don‚Äôt get me wrong; i‚Äôm all for discipline but beating students up like you are training for a rambo movie, verbally abusing a student like you‚Äôre some kinda raging alcoholic trying to win a screaming contest in a bar fight (you get the picture), mentally harassing a student because your husband hits on your student‚Äôs family friend‚Äôs older daughter at a mutual social gathering (yeah, that actually happened with me)....are all unacceptable :-| :-| :-|

i don't know if it's allowed to post this here but i don't know what to do ....i'm scared shitless right now. 

basically i'm having a crisis .... 

i'm having intrusive thoughts about well ... scary things .....

it started with an obsession about being accused of something falsely based on my post history and search history . though i'm not doing anything suspicious.... but i still had the fear due to me being from a poor family ... 

that escalated to ""maybe i am actually a criminal"" ... this seemed like an irrational thought but i started believing it out of fear and having additional thoughts like maybe i'm an insane criminal etc . and that this world is a hallucination and that in reality i'm a criminal... i'm still scared that this is a part of my updated fear  escalated to well ... that i'm going to hell and that my life would become miserable to the point of death ....

now the fear is because of a dream i had a while ago about how my life would become really scary and that i'd be drifted apart by everyone and would be hated and that i would hurt them too . or maybe that i was never loved and that i wouldn't be able to return to my loved ones

and that i'd lose everything basically .... which really scared me a lot . and in those dreams was a mysterious figure who looked like ryuk from the anime death note , mocking me . i was scared for some time but the fear subsided . now i'm getting scared even more ... because some details in that dream became true ... like me contemplating suicide or drugs.... but i was scared that that wouldn't be an end to it . it seems similar to right now...... which is really scary 

especially the ""not returning to loved ones part"" 

most of my friends are online and i'm in a long distance relationship ..... and because of those anxieties , i haven't contacted them ..... and i've been scared shitless ...... 

many of the other things i'm noticing are ""signs"" like typos , writings , ads and specefic coincidental wordings and events occuring that i take as ""warnings"" ......  and some bad things happening with me lately .... even my mom is acting weird ... this all seems determinential ..... it's so scary .... thinking of an eternal being waiting to torture you for eternity ......

i even saw 2 anime that matched the dream like babylon and hell girl ....... 

because of which i'm unable to let my guard down ....

and it's really scaring me ......

even if most relegions might not have hell ... i'm scared of there being a different hell .... from relegions ... that is eternal .... it's really scary and ruining my health

i'm scared of this possibility and don't know what to do ....",literallyIllliterlly,completely agree say except fact see psychologist would recommend see psychiatrist instead psychiatrist prescribe meds direct him her psychologist therapy think required,490,1,4.332661290322581,8.0,scared 18 know allowed post know scared shitless right now basically crisis intrusive thoughts well scary things started obsession accused something falsely based post history search history though anything suspicious still fear due poor family escalated maybe actually criminal seemed irrational thought started believing fear additional thoughts maybe insane criminal etc world hallucination reality criminal still scared part updated fear escalated well going hell life would become miserable point death fear dream ago life would become really scary d drifted apart everyone would hated would hurt maybe never loved able return loved ones d lose everything basically really scared lot dreams mysterious figure looked ryuk anime death note mocking scared time fear subsided getting scared even details dream became true contemplating suicide drugs scared end seems similar right now really scary especially not returning loved ones part friends online long distance relationship anxieties contacted ve scared shitless many things noticing signs typos writings ads specefic coincidental wordings events occuring take warnings bad things happening lately even mom acting weird seems determinential scary thinking eternal waiting torture eternity even saw anime matched dream babylon hell girl unable let guard really scaring even relegions might hell scared different hell relegions eternal really scary ruining health scared possibility know

after some time,the family went to  uttar pradesh,it was decided that the 2 elder girl would work in factory to increase the family income along with mother.

father served 3 months as a labourer after thr family left to pay back the money.

the previous worker before the family arrived was a bonded generation labourer (generation contact) who had 20 bighas of self owned land , but due to bonded labour ,he was working here while his family was on other state.

the farmer was quite powerful ,owner of buses, petrol pums, school, samsung brand shops, super stores , perhaps that could be reason that police doesn't act.

in the context of india, there are a few parameters i considered that show the growth of the society - 

1. population - contrary to the popular belief, our population growth has in fact slowed down to almost half it growth rate from previous years.
2. fertility rate - our average fertility rate is lower than the world average! we started from \~6 children per woman after independence and have gone down to \~2.1. the world average is 2.4.
3. life expectancy - our life expectancy is improving at a rate almost 2x the world average.
4. secondary school enrolment for girls - compared to the world average growth of 1.7%, india's rate of enrolment has been increasing at \~3.5x of that for the last 20 years!

so basically i was super bored with the quarantine and i was talking to my girlfriend about random stuff. so something about online dating came up. i made a bumble profile with 3 decent pictures , a good bio ,also verified account. guess how many matches i got ( 2 in an hour and 4 likes lol) . bear in mind both my girlfriend and i are about a solid 9 facially  (she's a bit better maybe) but my body is  a bit above average (good frame)with slight muscle but nothing too great, but i'm on the shorter side about  5'7(i'm in south delhi) but i certainly expected waay better results based on real life experience, i really didn't know how bad the competition is.  i wanted to see how demographics are skewed so i asked my girlfriend to send  3 random selfies  for experimenting , also none of these were taken with a proper camera(just front camera selfies) without the best lighting. also i had no bio besides a question and my profile was unverified.  i swiped to mostly hot guys 8+, and had a 90% match rate( ridiculous). all these guys looked like models  were tall , had bodies i'd assume from more than a year of solid gymming , had great photos taken by probably a professional camera and great bio and in general had a lot of effort put on their profile all to match with a low effort unverified profile.i got 350+ likes and 100+ matches in about an hour ,hour and a half i was basically bamboozled with disparity of likes even though both of us are similarly attractive. i understand the complaints of a lot of indian guys on bumble etc about not getting matches, but the fault is on guys and especially indian guys y'all way too thirsty and have no or extremely low standards( bumble doesn't have a lot of white guys, almost none) the pedestalising of girls is insane. you're basically competing with indian version of ""chad"" if you call that if you do use online dating. the average indian guy isn't attractive but online  there's a shit ton of ""hot"" guys in north india and most are on tinder/bumble so you'd probably get close to no matches, let alone decent ones and thats even if you're above average and have put a lot of effort in your profile. a girl in india on online dating is basically god mode. so anyone here even if you're hot guy  ( you'll probably lose your value since hot guys are dime a dozen here and fucks up the standards of all girls in general.), if you want to go for online dating.   don't.  
1. it basically spoils the notion of love in an insane way. basically makes it a number game which is frankly ridiculous to me. someone with 100+ hot guys in their profile won't be able to emotionally attach ,let alone choose between who they want. it's one of the reason is never wanted to date online even after way too many of my friends told me to. it's near impossible to find love where there isn't real time energy or connection involved.  

2. it raises the standards of even somewhat decent girls to an unattainable level for most guys who meet her and even hot guys , since all they have to do to find a hot guy is install and app an swipe. men are probably as expendable as ever. in real life attractive people you actually come across and interact with and get along with is rare and that what makes is special(chance for a spark).  online dating basically just gives you a plethora of these attractive people sitting at home  reducing the chances of someone being special to you way less and having a moment of actual chance encounters.(i met my girlfriend in a library, sorry i'm a hopeless romantic)

Non-Political,why do we believe in god?,16,fxuzbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxuzbv/why_do_we_believe_in_god/,32,2020-04-10 05:30:28,"have you really seen god? then why do you believe in him? i came out with 3 reasons for it.

1. age old manuscript/knowledge and books:

so, we are passed on from generations the books like gita, bible, and quran and many others. and people telling it from so long. the story of ram and krishna passed on through ages. it‚Äôs true or not, it does not matter. it was so beautifully written and embedded that even its not true. it‚Äôs worth considering. and no one can prove it wrong anyhow, why? that we will discuss in the third point.

2. exceptional bliss, fortune or lottery:

so, there are times people experience, so-called god bliss. by that, i mean a person facing a lot of issues in life may be due to a different person or someone. and after some time, like a lottery everything becomes fine, everything is so great around.

i think this happens with most of the people around. and that is how i think life is a game of probability that is not evenly distributed or maybe it is even. it‚Äôs like someone is so happy, someone is so rich, someone life is getting turned at this very moment, someone is poor, someone is going to die after a second of birth.

its all a game of probability, opportunities are probable, sometimes it is such that you hit a six at times when you are at the worst part of life, and you believe there is an external force acting and yes, it is. it is the force of probability.

and yeah, you may think it doesn‚Äôt happen with everyone, its probability, it happens with some people, so why everyone still believes in god. it‚Äôs because, if it happens to one, and the one is watched by many. so, everyone thinks, ya there is some force and there is some god. maybe there is‚Ä¶

3. you cannot prove something, that doesn‚Äôt exist:

so, a great philosopher. i don‚Äôt remember exactly who, once said if anyone asks you, do god exists or not. you can say yes, it exists. why?

because if god exists, you are right. and if he doesn‚Äôt exist, then you can never prove something that doesn‚Äôt exist. like if i say, i am seeing a god, a unicorn or something in this room, and even if it exists or not. you will say it does not. but in this infinite, exponentially expanding universe, that you cannot see, how will you prove that a thing/force does not exist. you cannot prove negativity. you cannot prove things that don‚Äôt exist. you can only prove things that exist.",vikashred,reason believe politicians good pr stupidity,432,6,4.357466063348416,3.3333333333333335,believe god really seen god believe him came 3 reasons 1 age old manuscript knowledge books so passed generations books gita bible quran many others telling long story ram krishna passed ages true not matter beautifully written embedded even true worth considering prove wrong anyhow why discuss third point exceptional bliss fortune lottery so times experience so called god bliss that mean person facing lot issues life may due different person someone time lottery everything becomes fine everything great around think happens around think life game probability evenly distributed maybe even someone happy someone rich someone life getting turned moment someone poor someone going die second birth game probability opportunities probable sometimes hit six times worst part life believe external force acting yes is force probability yeah may think doesn t happen everyone probability happens everyone still believes god because happens watched many so everyone thinks ya force god maybe is 3 cannot prove something doesn t exist so great philosopher don t remember exactly who said anyone asks you god exists not say yes exists why god exists right doesn t exist never prove something doesn t exist say seeing god unicorn something room even exists not say not infinite exponentially expanding universe cannot see prove thing force exist cannot prove negativity cannot prove things don t exist prove things exist

my parents are hoping that i might come around and say yes to the indian societal acceptance of marriage. i am honestly exhausted putting up with my mum. we argue sometimes but more than that i feel massive guilt. have i taken their happiness from them? have i caused shame to my family for what i am? what if people start asking questions when my brother is getting married and me being the elder one is still unmarried? should i just give up on life where i could be myself and just submit to them and spend my life in a loveless and sexless marriage?

all these questions have been haunting me for the last ten years! i never had any friend that i could trust to tell them that i have been considering suicide for the past year or so, that i have been exhausted of living with myself and the world around me that doesn‚Äôt help. i have all of these thoughts inside that are eating me up alive and i feel that hell is inside me.

i feel so alone and dejected in life. all i have ever done in these twenty years is to suck it up all in and never show my vulnerability. all my life i adapted to not feel anything and do everything like i have been told. i get high everyday to drown the sorrow that nobody loves me. i have never had a boyfriend or felt the butterflies! 

honestly i thought i could move out of the country but that option is looking bleak. i don‚Äôt have enough money saved for the move and the depression is getting stronger that i am losing the will to do anything to achieve my dream. there is inherently something wrong with me and i can‚Äôt put my finger on it. travelling is all i wanted to do. but all i can think of is how fucking ugly i am with absolutely no skills to boast for. like being a useless log that lies in bed all day. 

if this is all there is i would rather pull the trigger soon after i make enough money to support my parents after i am gone. i have nothing to look forward to, life‚Äôs a drag and i don‚Äôt want to continue the chain of bringing more lives into this ruthless world.

- the outsider : if you liked it, it chapter 2 etc...the man who wrote them all in the first place wrote another novel in 2018. this ones grounded in reality, yet plays around with the idea of the supernatural.    

- broadchurch :  david tennants (killgrave from jessicajones) character as a hard boiled grumpy detective with a thick brit accent (if you're used to him from jj), and the naturally flowing whodunit story about a murdered child.     

- sons of anarchy : biker gang that goes running drugs and porn for business. its a cool show that has family drama - and then lots of bassassery and violence.

property ads on a billboard in the outskirts of pune will feature a caucasian couple with their children & dog(s).

internet service providers in mumbai will feature a light skinned african woman with a regulation sized afro in a business formal outfit, posing with a folder and flashing a million dollar smile & a thumbs up.

nationalized banks's car loan advertisement will have a white guy in a european sedan.

a tiny 3 seater men's hair saloon which has a headshot zayn malik from 2013 posing with a purple suit, in hyderabad. an absolutely random white model with a blonde hairstyle from 2079 stares at you on the other side of the flex board.

it companies will have their email headers, policy mails, announcements feature a group of well manicured, well groomed ""diverse"" young executives all huddled in a glass conference room looking at an older white explaining some random shit on a white presentation board.

an electronics store in ahmedabad with a saucy looking brunette, distinctly european woman in a red top and a grey skirt talking on her mobile phone. 

a cute white kid with beach blonde hair in oversized glasses and a book in his hand - used for advertising a new school in ulhasnagar - and some fancy title about aspiring to be a interplanetary dietician.

even pet stores will have a button nosed, blonde girl with two ponytail running behind a golden retriever in their flex board.

and how can we forget the tuition classes \ computer class adverts & pamphlets & brochures which have the whole high school stereotype clique posing with bags & large books - one girl in glasses, a white guy in a green tee shirt, the athletic looking jock who's almost always african, an adorable asian girl in a chic jacket - among others.

pubs, hotels, cafes & restaurants are almost always the worst offenders with their blond-guy-and-blond-girl-partying-with-green-disco-lights-in-the-back; one token black guy with a metallic coloured shirt grooving; black girl sipping a coffee in front of a laptop, kid eating a hamburger imagery rehashed across the damn length & breadth of the country.

it took years before even our airports started featuring explicitly indian models (but in ott traditional, regional outfits) for general directions & imagery. and banks too.

and even in this - we don't leave behind our inherent racism - light skinned african men & women are cool - but that's the extreme end of our diversity. no overtly muslim women wearing headscarves \ hijabs, no men with skull caps at all. 

beards are always like a hipster's from milwaukee or a swedish business man's - but never like rajdeep or salim. 

even the banyan advertisements feature our bollywood stars posing with bavarian looking models in an ms paint gradient metallic blue \ grey background.

i understand we thrive with the free use material & basic google search stock images - but why are we still not using indian models & faces to sell indian products.

dark skinned indians, east indians are never even ***considered*** for representation - let alone headline these ad campaigns.

[R]eddiquette,chandrayaan moon landing,502,d0ffgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0ffgv/chandrayaan_moon_landing/,1402,2019-09-07 01:02:53,"isro's chandrayaan 2 mission is a significant technological event that has kept space watchers in india and across the world riveted. the mission to land an indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd july, 2019. 

chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, vikram, the lander, and pragyan, the lunar rover. 

the landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**edit i: (7th september)**


communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

to space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**edit ii: (8th september)**

the chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

isro confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. the chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

there is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

so i first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. the way he stands, the way he looks. dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
i wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. i used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. his parent died when he was too young to talk. was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. he used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

its been 6 months, i've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. he dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

there is a couple in mid 50s i know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. i know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

all my rants about life just vanished. problems are still there. i earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. it gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words. 

name of boy - ivaan

have a blessed day all!

[R]eddiquette,how unethical/illegal is my doctor mom's behavior?,419,cy9zyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cy9zyu/how_unethicalillegal_is_my_doctor_moms_behavior/,171,2019-09-02 03:04:51,"mom is a gynecologist by profession. she has ties with some medical representatives (mrs) where they give her medicine to sell directly at rate cheaper than the shop. she then sells that medicine to patients directly or sends them to the medical shop. shopkeeper gives her all the money sold from the medicines back.

 she once showed me a brochure which contained different gifts based on number of tablets written . it was a plasma tv for something like 8,500 tablets but she chose something else.

she also does this thing where she sends a 50rs injection to the medical shop (which dad owns but rents out to others) and writes  a different injection name on prescription paper worth rs. 5,000. patient pays 5k to shopkeeper who then brings the money, injection back to her. 

she was really frustrated when they introduced compulsory attendance of certain number of medical conferences per year for doctors. luckily, mrs get the certificates of conferences for her so she doesn't have to attend a single one! she stores some medicines directly in the medical shop that mrs giver her which she writes and the shop owner gives some commission to her for them.

 she has tie ups with a pathologist, where every patient she refers to him, he gives certain amount of money back to her (like 30%) from his fees. once, she was showing me pathologist's report for fun to read. i found value of platelet written - 45,000 and underline under it. normal value written next to it was 150k i think. she said without even looking its 450k, read again. i double checked but nope it was 45,000. she looked at it and got very furious. she immediately called the pathologist and said how dare he didn't tell her immediately and only underline it for her. she said that patient would have gotten serious if not died with that low platelet count. she said, she will instead send all patients to a different pathologist who gives her more cashback from now on if he does something like this again. 

once a civil surgeon came to check her records and she had them badly incomplete. i remember she was facing removal of her sonography machine at least. luckily, dad went to meet the civil surgeon few times and paid him around ~1l to keep queit. mom was complaining how stupid these records are, how much work she has to already do. how unfair this all is on her.

mom casually mentioned she failed final year of her mbbs but dad paid a lecturer to pass her. how her diploma doesn't mean anything because it is from a non certified organization; but it has the same initials as the official diploma so people would get fooled into thinking she has one.


gore ahead - parents hospital is on ground floor and we live upstairs. growing up, i used to regularly see different meat like parts in a regular dustbin, next to her operation theater. once a stray dog was eating what looked like placenta from the dustbin. she would pay money to some midwife to dispose off fetuses and bury them into ground somewhere secluded. she was pretty mad when someone complained about her throwing bio hazardous waste in the surrounding area which did she used to do i think.

she reminds me without fail regularly how much money she earns and how many people recognize her outside because she is doctor. how much respect doctors get in society. she would say would say none gets as much respect as doctors do. once we were going for a family vacation and a bike going at speed got slammed by a car right in front of us. i asked dad shouldn't we stop and help them, aren't you guys doctors and are supposed to help?"" dad said, ""who is going to spend that much time taking him to nearest hospital? the guy is probably very serious if not dead already."" so, we chose to continue to our trip.

e: i never meant it as some sort of psa.  it was more of a venting from my childhood memories . mom has been very abusive to me and recalling those memories; i have lot of amnesia around them and it is very stressful, anxiety inducing. its easy to type these ones out because they don't involve me. 

also they might seem clear to you guys, but i have lived in that home for 21 years. my first memories are formed  while living with my mom. this is quite the norm in my house and i was exposed to only these values, culture, environment most of my life. parents wouldn't let me go outside much either, i was suicidal for a long time. i am very gaslighted from living with them. it feels really nice to know these things are very looked down upon and every comment helps with the gaslighting.",concernedbrothrowawa,deleted,823,7,4.488484848484848,6.285714285714286,unethical illegal doctor mom behavior mom gynecologist profession ties medical representatives mrs give medicine sell directly rate cheaper shop sells medicine patients directly sends medical shop shopkeeper gives money sold medicines back showed brochure contained different gifts based number tablets written plasma tv something 8 500 tablets chose something else thing sends 50rs injection medical shop which dad owns rents others writes different injection name prescription paper worth rs 5 000 patient pays 5k shopkeeper brings money injection back her really frustrated introduced compulsory attendance certain number medical conferences per year doctors luckily mrs certificates conferences attend single stores medicines directly medical shop mrs giver writes shop owner gives commission them tie ups pathologist every patient refers him gives certain amount money back 30 fees once showing pathologist report fun read found value platelet written 45 000 underline normal value written next 150k think said without even looking 450k read again double checked nope 45 000 looked got furious immediately called pathologist said dare tell immediately underline her said patient would gotten serious died low platelet count said instead send patients different pathologist gives cashback something again civil surgeon came check records badly incomplete remember facing removal sonography machine least luckily dad went meet civil surgeon times paid around 1l keep queit mom complaining stupid records are much work already do unfair her mom casually mentioned failed final year mbbs dad paid lecturer pass her diploma mean anything non certified organization initials official diploma would fooled thinking gore ahead parents hospital ground floor live upstairs growing up used regularly see different meat parts regular dustbin next operation theater stray dog eating looked placenta dustbin would pay money midwife dispose fetuses bury ground somewhere secluded pretty mad someone complained throwing bio hazardous waste surrounding area used think reminds without fail regularly much money earns many recognize outside doctor much respect doctors society would say would say none gets much respect doctors do going family vacation bike going speed got slammed car right front us asked dad stop help them guys doctors supposed help dad said who going spend much time taking nearest hospital guy probably serious dead already so chose continue trip e never meant sort psa venting childhood memories mom abusive recalling memories lot amnesia around stressful anxiety inducing easy type ones involve me might seem clear guys lived home 21 years first memories formed living mom quite norm house exposed values culture environment life parents let go outside much either suicidal long time gaslighted living them feels really nice know things looked upon every comment helps gaslighting

*via [ indian express | explained: what has changed in jammu and kashmir ](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-article-370-has-not-been-scrapped-but-kashmirs-special-status-has-gone-5880390/)*

in effect, the state of jammu and kashmir will now cease to exist; it will be replaced by two new union territories: jammu and kashmir, and ladakh. uts have become states earlier; **this is the first time that a state has been converted into a ut.** the ut of jammu and kashmir will have an assembly, like in delhi and puducherry. the ut of ladakh will not, like chandigarh.

so, not only has jammu and kashmir lost its special status, it has been given a status lower than that of other states.

it is also likely that corporates and individuals will be able to buy land in jammu and kashmir. non-kashmiris might now get jobs in kashmir. a process of demographic change might begin, and progress over the coming decades.

# indian opinion

writing in the [indian express |  the story of indian democracy written in blood and betrayal  ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jammu-kashmir-article-370-scrapped-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-bjp-5880797/), pratap bahnu mehta says

>this is a state for whom the only currency that matters is raw power. this is a state that recognises no constraints of law, liberty and morality. this is a state that will make a mockery of democracy and deliberation. this is a state whose psychological principle is fear. this is a state that will make ordinary citizens cannon fodder for its warped nationalist pretensions.

>india has betrayed its own constitutional promises. india has many asymmetric federalism arrangements outside of kashmir. this act potentially sets the precedent for invalidating all of them. how can we justify offering nagaland asymmetric federalism but deny it to kashmir? its implication is that the government can unilaterally declare any existing state to be a union territory. this is a constitutional first. we are simply a union of union territories that happen to be a state at the discretion of the centre.

>what is playing out in kashmir is the warped psyche of a great civilisation at its insecure worst. the bjp thinks it is going to indianise kashmir. **but, instead, what we will see is potentially the kashmirisation of india: the story of indian democracy written in blood and betrayal.**

writing in [the wire | constitution torn to shreds as rss indulges article 370 fantasy in kashmir](https://thewire.in/politics/constitution-torn-to-shreds-as-rss-indulges-article-370-fantasy-in-kashmir) siddharth varadarajan says

>not only has union home minister amit shah stripped article 370 of its essence, he has gone one step further and abolished the entire state as well, replacing it with two ‚Äòbantustans‚Äô ‚Äì grandly called ‚Äòunion territories‚Äô ‚Äì in which key decisions on a range of issues like law and order and land will be taken not by the people and their elected representatives, but by bureaucrats from new delhi.

>except, j&k has already enjoyed the rigours of central rule for nearly 10 of the past 45 years, and has turned out none the better for it. the last 12 months have seen prime minister narendra modi himself calling the shots, through the president and governor, but the situation there continues to be even worse than it was when the bjp helped run the state government along with the people‚Äôs democratic party from 2015 to 2018.

>make no mistake about this ‚Äì what amit shah and narendra modi have unveiled on monday is not just an assault on the unique place that jammu and kashmir enjoys in india but on the very federal structure of the indian constitution. if they spent their first term in office undermining a whole host of institutions, modi 2.0 will target the one institution that was still somewhat intact ‚Äì federalism.

writing in the [indian express |  we are just at the beginning](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/article-370-kashmir-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-govt-5880796/) imad ul riyaz says

>my appreciation for india, and that of many other kashmiris, and the desire to stand by it in the face of hostility and bullying back home, was sustained by the constitution. today, we are dejected, appalled and feel betrayed. the issue is not just about the abrogation of article 370 ‚Äî it is about the unconstitutional manner in which the exercise is being carried out, the way national and international treaties have been violated. most importantly, it is about the manner in which the views of the people of jammu and kashmir were ignored.

writing in the [washington post | modi‚Äôs kashmir gamble may be good politics, but peace should be the ultimate goal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/05/modis-kashmir-gamble-may-be-good-politics-peace-should-be-ultimate-goal/) barkha dutt says

>yet this serious gamble for the future of kashmir ‚Äî which could either be a game-changer or set back peace-building efforts by several years ‚Äî plays politically well for modi and his home minister and second-in-command, amit shah. for one, it pleases modi‚Äôs core base and delivers on an old promise (the ruling bjp‚Äôs manifesto had always promised to implement this). also, with the exception of only a handful, most political parties have backed the government for what it has called the ‚Äúintegration of kashmir into the mainstream.‚Äú

>the modi government has scored a political victory. but will it alter the course of the 29-year-old insurgency in the kashmir valley? one of the most worrisome aspects of the last few hours has been how the government has treated mainstream kashmiri politicians as if they were anti-national separatists. many of them braved great dangers and faced great pressure to contest elections and maintain allegiance to the indian state. weakening them further ‚Äî one leader told me the latest move ‚Äúreduces them to zero‚Äù ‚Äî raises questions about who the government opens a dialogue process with should the time come.

i followed the herd and ended up studying engineering. now that i'm trying to look for jobs hardly anyone is interested in me as i'm unexceptional. in this brutally competitive world can someone as vanilla as me attain great success? repeated rejection in romantic life, professional life has eroded my self belief. 

i had a suspicion ever since i was in my early teens that i was unintelligent. it'd take me a much longer time to grasp a concept compared to my peers. initially it did bother me but then i developed a thicker skin. my parents also are concerned about my future. just wanted to let it out.",Voyager910,offend anyone u feel grasping science concepts hard you try something art related command english top notch writing articles journals drawing music stuff that good luck,181,8,4.683060109289618,3.375,average guy do opinion average person appearance wise consider unlovely instead leaning euphemism make truth palatable ll state unabashedly short ugly born family modest means since childhood ve never exceptional performer school probably featured bottom few indolent despite best efforts seldom perform better average followed herd ended studying engineering trying look jobs hardly anyone interested unexceptional brutally competitive world someone vanilla attain great success repeated rejection romantic life professional life eroded self belief suspicion ever since early teens unintelligent d take much longer time grasp concept compared peers initially bother developed thicker skin parents concerned future wanted let out
[R]eddiquette,i was about to be falsely accused in a harassment case today but got saved thanks to some good samaritans.,1051,cjtxxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cjtxxj/i_was_about_to_be_falsely_accused_in_a_harassment/,225,2019-07-31 05:41:00,"my apartment has a gym which can be used by the residents. today i walked in a little early at around 6 pm. when i entered the gym, the first thing i heard was an older lady telling me to get out. i replied excuse me, as i was genuinely confused. to which she pointed at the door and said get out in a louder harsher tone. this really irked me and i confronted her and asked her to talk politely to which she said gym has ladies time from 4 pm to 7 pm. i told her there is no such rule written anywhere and asked her to show me proof. to this, she replied to go talk to the manager. i told her since it's her claim, she should show me proof to which she said don't argue, just get out. i told her even i can bring a couple of guys in the gym and tell you, people, that this is gents hour if i don't have proof, to which she shouted even more loudly saying don't talk back and asked me to get out. i just scoffed and proceeded to walk to my workout station where she physically stopped me and said something like such mannerless youth come here nowadays. i replied saying, i am just asking a question, which i have the right to and proceeded to my workout station by walking around her.

i think this hurt her ego, and she went and called the manager. when the manager came, she told him i was rude to her and was harassing her physically (her claim was i pushed her and went) and her aunty squad was backing her up. in fact, this woman had grabbed my hand and tried to physically stop me from entering and now was accusing me of me abusing her verbally and pushing her. this is when i really wanted to whack her, but knowing how the law works it would have gone to her favor. luckily, some other women in the gym stood up for me and said i didn't do anything but ask her for proof of the rule to which the aunty replied something akin to us accusing her of lying (which she was). when she knew she wasn't going to win this, she started demanding an apology from me, which i obviously refused. this is when she abused me some more and said something on the lines of aaj kal ke ye bacche and left while threatening me she will handle me later. i think that's when the manager realized the lady was full of shit. he then calmly explained to me about the new gym timing rules. i told him, if she would have politely asked me to leave and shown me the new rule, i would have left. i just confronted her because she was extremely rude to me for no reason. 

dunno where this entitlement comes from in these old fucks. just because they are old, they think they can get away with anything.

**tl;dr: i was accused of verbal and physical abuse by some old aunty because i asked her a question and got saved by some women in my gym.**



**edit: manager took the blame in the end and apologized for that, to which i said that's fine. this rule was instated some 3 days ago and was apparently sent to everyone in the building whatsapp group (which i am not a part of since my brother owns the flat). so the lady had a physical copy of the rule on her. but she didn't want to show it to me because elders should be listened to without any questions. i told the manager to please post it on the door or something so something like this doesn't happen again. i also told him, the only reason i got irked was that the lady was being really rude and downright abusive.**",sleepygamer92,please ask manager install cameras gym,657,20,4.074242424242424,4.35,falsely accused harassment case today got saved thanks good samaritans apartment gym used residents today walked little early around 6 pm entered gym first thing heard older lady telling out replied excuse me genuinely confused pointed door said louder harsher tone really irked confronted asked talk politely said gym ladies time 4 pm 7 pm told rule written anywhere asked show proof this replied go talk manager told since claim show proof said argue out told even bring couple guys gym tell you gents hour proof shouted even loudly saying talk back asked out scoffed proceeded walk workout station physically stopped said something mannerless youth come nowadays replied saying asking question right proceeded workout station walking around her think hurt ego went called manager manager came told rude harassing physically her claim pushed went aunty squad backing up fact woman grabbed hand tried physically stop entering accusing abusing verbally pushing her really wanted whack her knowing law works would gone favor luckily women gym stood said anything ask proof rule aunty replied something akin us accusing lying which was knew going win this started demanding apology me obviously refused abused said something lines aaj kal ke ye bacche left threatening handle later think that manager realized lady full shit calmly explained new gym timing rules told him would politely asked leave shown new rule would left confronted extremely rude reason dunno entitlement comes old fucks old think away anything tl dr accused verbal physical abuse old aunty asked question got saved women gym edit manager took blame end apologized that said that fine rule instated 3 days ago apparently sent everyone building whatsapp group which part since brother owns flat lady physical copy rule her want show elders listened without questions told manager please post door something something happen again told him reason got irked lady really rude downright abusive

remember the outrage that nirbhaya case caused? kathua's outrage was less. unnao's even lesser. these days, there is no daily newspaper without a rape case.

remember the outrage when a minister said peacock reproduces by tears? these days, even our hrd minister spews such bs on a daily basis infront of highly educated audience no less.

remember mohammad akhlaq's lynching case? the accused was seen in front row of a cm's rally. ramgarh mob lynching? a minister garlanded the convicted group. in malegaon blast case, the accused is a minister now. again, mob lynchings have become common news these days.

remember demo (oh wait, i am sure you would)? how the govt. was criticised for an unplanned decision making? there's one such decision every month. a record number of bills have been passed in the 100 days of govt.

the eruption that #metoo, casting couch scandals caused? an actress coming out these days would be seen as 'just another'. one popular outcome of that is the dissolution of aib. where are the other popular accused these days? 

remember the 2g scam? mining scam? lalit modi? mallya? nirav modi? panama papers? yeddy diaries? he is the cm of karnataka now. that time when jagan reddy went to jail? he is the cm of ap now. 

jet airways? air india is slowly getting there. bsnl almost there. hal racing to reach both. automobile industry, ongc has their first hits recently. 


dollar rate was 48 when i was writing gk exams at school. where is it now? 5%, what is 5%?

it's the story of frog in a hot water bath. we are going down, slowly but surely. 

sorry if i made you sad. cheer up! we have to support india in our next series versus south africa and btw, how is the boom in kashmir real estate and matrimony industries?

edit: thanks a lot for the appreciation. i now understand that this is a well known issue called ['overton effect']( https://youtu.be/_v-hzc6blgi). 

in all honesty, i don't mean to offend/take pot shots at any particular thing/group. when nirbhaya happened, our batch discussed about for a week. i used to be very vocal. kathua, unnao took it down to an hour. last month, there was a news of <1 yo baby kidnapped, raped, and murdered in my own state. there was a news of rape of a dog. i don't feel a thing except for a minute or two.

>india had informed about counter terrorism (ct) action it took yesterday against a training camp of jaish-e-mohammed (jem) in pakistan based on credible evidence that jem intended to launch more attacks. against this counter terrorism action, pakistan has responded this morning by using its air force to target military installations on the indian side. due to our high state of readiness and alertness, pakistan‚Äôs attempts were foiled successfully.

>the pakistan air force was detected and the indian air force responded instantly. in that aerial engagement, one pakistan air force fighter aircraft was shot down by a mig 21 bison of the indian air force. the pakistani aircraft was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the pakistan side. in this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one mig 21. the pilot is missing in action. pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. we are ascertaining the facts.

however that changed after i got it installed and running today. basically the router is locked down. you can't use non jio routers to connect, there's no username / password settings to use for another non jio router.

the biggest security issue is your jio router can be managed by my jio app like changing ssid, password, blocking device etc and it works even remotely (outside your wifi network). so the only thing stopping a attacker is myjio authentication which i'm sure can be cracked. moreover if they get access to network from jio side, they can literally do anything. run exploits against your networked devices etc.

and remote management is disabled by default so there's no way to stop myjio app access.

**[bjp manifesto](https://www.bjp.org/en/manifesto2019)**

**[congress manifesto](https://manifesto.inc.in/en/)**

the bjp manifesto is available in hindi and english, while the congress manifesto is available in hindi, english, odia, telugu, kannada, marathi, punjabi, assamese.

i've provided a few highlights from both the manifestos. the manifestos are large and it is not possible to cover all the points. i have covered the points which i believe are easier to judge on implementability.

many smart hindus argue that you can be an atheist and still be hindu because there were many ancient atheistic schools in india, like the *charvaka*. but the thing is charvaka was an exception in hinduism, not the rule. many other ancient cultures were quite similar too, who were absolutely materialistic and atheistic. claiming that they were all modern secular humanists who considered nothing but science would be even more wrong. there's nothing common between modern-day atheism and those ancient cultures except disbelief in supernatural. i still don't get how someone is a modern-day atheist and still be a hindu culturally or otherwise.",I_can_believe_that,deleted,361,8,4.94475138121547,3.625,easy atheist mean lynched parents coming atheist they ll disappointed best understand all that main problem here main problem difficult criticize hinduism unlike major religions christianity islam hinduism suffers dissociative identity disorder many argue way life cultural identity unique sub continent mainstream religion reality evidently religion someone questions verses holy scriptures best reply oh hindus follow scriptures strictly muslims christians someone questions certain practices hinduism blame culture tradition society even ones said hinduism way life simply religion double standard confuses many young trying question faiths end give reconcile believing hinduism completely evil western religions many still can t comprehend evils caste system affected lives lower caste communities thousands years even living denial back kid believed varna system hinduism evil evil caste system created british least that taught first questioned system many smart hindus argue atheist still hindu many ancient atheistic schools charvaka thing charvaka exception hinduism rule many ancient cultures quite similar too absolutely materialistic atheistic claiming modern secular humanists considered nothing science would even wrong there nothing common modern day atheism ancient cultures except disbelief supernatural still someone modern day atheist still hindu culturally otherwise

italy recently has its own political crisis after an uneasy coalition collapsed because of the racist home minister's party being a fifth column in government.

brexit is happening because closeted xenophobic sentiments have been exploited in full. france nearly elected a xenophobe in marine le pen as its president.

austria had a semi-hardliner as its chancellor not too many months ago.

hungary and several other eu border states hate immigrants.

poland is turning hard-liner after its government tried to mess with the independence of its judiciary.

it is well known that the fat cats of the middle east are deeply involved in any conflicts in the region.

duterte of the philippines rose to power on the drugs bogeyman, taking the law into his own hands and running a bloody pogrom against anyone he believed to be a drug peddler.

putin is widely accused of influencing elections in many adversary states (read: pro-us states) and his government also cracks down on political opposition within russia.

ukraine turned into a political tug-of-war between russia and the west.

underdeveloped central and north african nations like sudan, nigeria and somalia continue to be pretty unstable.

brazil's president is trump's protege on environmental matters.

within asia, imran khan's party was largely seen as a hard-line pro-islam party, although his election platform was focused more on corruption by nawaz sharif.

even in india, bjp's election platform subtly switched from development to pseudo-nationalism, as was always predicted by anyone with half a brain. the worst part is people lapped it up and gave modi a thumping majority, bigger than his previous one! he's used it to stifle the opposition and captured the media.

> at 3pm on august 13 2004, akku yadav was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from kasturba nagar. it took them 15 minutes to hack to death the man they say raped them with impunity for more than a decade. chilli powder was thrown in his face and stones hurled. as he flailed and fought, one of his alleged victims hacked off his penis with a vegetable knife. a further 70 stab wounds were left on his body. the incident was made all the more extraordinary by its setting. yadav was murdered not in the dark alleys of the slum, but on the shiny white marble floor of nagpur district court.

> laughed at and abused by the police when they reported being raped by yadav, the women took the law into their own hands. a local thug, yadav and his gang had terrorised the 300 families of kasturba nagar for more than a decade, barging into homes demanding money, shouting threats and abuse.

&#x200b;

‚Ä¢ increasing the npa of banks means. scarcity of capital which means no fresh investment. the glorification of bankrupt law and continuous scams in companies

‚Ä¢ homes are not being sold which means sale of  steel, cement, bathroom fittings, construction declining. with this banks npas will grow. these npas go deep into individual level by making the crisis deeper,

‚Ä¢ vehicle sales are declining. at present first time in the country sale of  two wheelers are showing negative growth. maruti has cut down production by 50%. many of the auto dealers are closing down. this means  there is substantial reduction demand for steel, tyre and other accessories.

&#x200b;

the above three things are meant to be the end of the crores of jobs and the reduction of government's tax revenues. in such a situation, the government becomes frustrated and wants to complete its loss by putting taxes on everything, the government hands over the profits in private hands and puts the deficit in the government account. in such a situation, the government properties are sold in multiples of their favorite corporate and the losses increase.

&#x200b;

crisis in india will be visible around march 2020, most of the average indians are unaware about this.  it's time to be careful when you are not able to sell soap, shampoo and detergent.

for the past few years, even the  fmcg sector is  also in the  grip of recession-. do you remember  when you have  last seen baba ramdev's patanjali company's advertisement?  patanjali was most active on tv about 2 years back., but for last one year, the condition of even patanjali  which grew at the fastest pace in india's fmcg market is alarming.. sales of patanjali's products is shrinking.  apart from this, patanjali ayurveda has shown 10% revenue deficit in fy 2018. not only companies such as patanjali but hindustan lever also have come down in growth. demand for fast-selling consumer goods such as soap, toothpaste, hair oil, biscuits etc. has decreased considerably in rural areas. this has also slowed down the performance of those businesses, which are dependent on healthy rural demand. it includes fmcg, two-wheeler and auto companies that make entry-level cars.

now come on the transport-according to the  report of the indian foundation of transport research and training,  15% drop in truck rentals has reported since november 2018.  also fleet utilization has dropped more than that. all 75 trunk routes, rentals have gone down substantially. between april and june, fleet utilization has decreased 25% to 30% compared to the first quarter of last year. this also reduces the income of transporters by about 30%. many operators may also come in the fleet's emi default in the next quarter.

there is a clear impact on the freight demand because of reduction in industrial production. demand from the manufacturing sector, which contributes the most to truck transport, is at minimum level. consumers spending in cities and rural areas have reduced and transportation in agriculture has almost become sluggish after the peak demand of april. in june, the demand for fruits and vegetables by fmcg has decreased by 20%.

background: i(m24) have been with my girlfriend(f24) for around 1 and a half year now. our relationship isn't the most stable, my gf has anger issues and i am not the most easily forgiving person either. we fight quite a bit. a few weeks ago, after a major fight my girlfriend told me ""let's not commit right now, let's see each other but not commit"" i was okay with that, i don't really love her or anything, and i keep thinking about other women all the time. additionally, i'm a virgin while she's had a relationship before and lost her virginity in that. i've always wanted to have my first time with a girl i actually loved and cared about, and possibly was married to.

we've made out in the past. indulged in some fingering but that was it. today, we decided to meet for a short while in our favorite spot where we always do. we sat and talked. long story short, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. being my first time, it was all over in 5-7 minutes. after i was finished, i sat there in a daze. my gf asked for water and wanted to clean up. i sat there, as if i'd been stupefied. it took her repeating herself thrice before i paid attention to her.

even as i type this, it is very difficult for me to come to terms with my feelings about the entire affair. even after we bid each other goodbye and i walked to my apartment, i walked in a daze, where i was mechanically doing everything without really thinking about it. i looked around and i literally had trouble perceiving the world. its like, i took in the sights and sounds but my brain wasn't processing them.

i feel no joy. i feel no happiness that i had sex barely 2 hours ago. all i feel is a void, where some sense of gratification should be. i don't love this girl. we fight so much. and who knows what complications this might lead to. i want some love, i want to be able to look into a woman's eyes and know she's the one for me as i have sex with her. i don't feel this way about my current gf. and i hate this feeling. this is why i had refused to have sex with her so far. i have never felt so distant from her as i do right after having had sex with her. this is a bad sign, right?

i don't want to say she made me do it. true, it was she who took her pants off and pulled me towards her, and guided my penis inside her. true, but i was there . i could have stopped her. and she probably wouldn't have resisted. i did not. i could have said no, but for some reason i didn't. i don't want to pretend like i was forced into sexual activity. i was there with my consent.

she is very happy about us finally having sex. i am not. it just feels wrong.

i feel like i'm making a big deal out of nothing, but idk. i'm not sure who to turn to with this. i'm a man. i'll probably be told to shut up and be happy i'm getting action. but i don't feel happy about this. how do i come to terms with my feelings?",98Uhu,dump her find someone actually loves,590,10,4.033500837520938,4.0,lost virginity unsure feelings posted elsewhere posting think audience relate fellow background m24 girlfriend f24 around 1 half year now relationship stable gf anger issues easily forgiving person either fight quite bit weeks ago major fight girlfriend told let commit right now let see commit okay that really love anything keep thinking women time additionally virgin relationship lost virginity that ve always wanted first time girl actually loved cared about possibly married to we ve made past indulged fingering today decided meet short favorite spot always do sat talked long story short thing led another ended sex first time 5 7 minutes finished sat daze gf asked water wanted clean up sat there d stupefied took repeating thrice paid attention her even type this difficult come terms feelings entire affair even bid goodbye walked apartment walked daze mechanically everything without really thinking looked around literally trouble perceiving world took sights sounds brain processing them feel joy feel happiness sex barely hours ago feel void sense gratification be love girl fight much knows complications might lead to want love want able look woman eyes know sex her feel way current gf hate feeling refused sex far never felt distant right sex her bad sign right want say made true took pants pulled towards her guided penis inside her true could stopped her probably resisted not could said no reason didn t want pretend forced sexual activity consent happy us finally sex not feels wrong feel making big deal nothing idk sure turn this man ll probably told shut happy getting action feel happy this come terms feelings

[R]eddiquette,so many consultancies are trying to dupe students/freshers looking for jobs. this is what happened to me.,309,c84t0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c84t0z/so_many_consultancies_are_trying_to_dupe/,65,2019-07-02 18:02:17,"i am looking for a job while currently pursuing my masters. since i graduated in economics with no technical skills in hand, the majority of jobs being offered to me are crappy bpo and backend ones. 

me and my friend who's in the same boat decided to apply on job portals and we start getting all sorts of calls hiring for voice/non voice process. some of them were bonafide but i think, majority of them were from fraud consultancies. i got an offer for an interview in delhi's badarpur and accepted to come for the interview. the day before, i was wondering that nothing good has ever happened in badarpur and did a quick google search only to find a consumer complaint filed against the 'consultancy' that i was going to. 

a few days later, me and my friend got another offer for an interview in two consultancies that were in very close proximity to each other. we, being the idiots we are, forget to double check and went to the agencies the next day. i, although asked everything about any hidden charges and ofcourse she lied.


the one i went to made me wait for about half an hour for the interview, i have given interviews before and knew this is not how it works. *mujhe pata chal gaya tha mera chutiya kat chuka hai.* the interviewer was hardly 10th pass who was struggling to ask questions in english and the moment she uttered i can offer you 35k, i knew this is a scam and she's about to ask me for money which she did. there's no way i can get 35k even if i sold my body to a pimp. so i stormed out of there and called my friend.


what happened with him is more interesting, when they asked him for money, he got himself out by saying he need some time to think. he went down to smoke and he saw three police officers marching towards the building. the moment they saw my friend they asked ""how much were they asking?"". my friend replied 10k but he gave them nothing. he showed them the way inside the building.


so my friend was sitting outside the room where the interviews took place watching the entire raid taking place. a btech graduate who paid 2k rupees as 'security' to the the frauds comes after giving a ""telephonic interview"" and says to my friend *bhut tough interview tha, aadhe ghante grill kia*. the police officer shouted from inside *koi interview nahi tha, iska pati hai vo*. this poor delusional guy was still under the impression that he'll get the job untill everything was explained to him.  he gave the lady 2k rupees which the police got back from her.



any adequately informed job seeker who has given at least one interview knows that only frauds asks money from candidates but i guess there are still people who in desperation, will oblige and pay.

i also feel like an idiot for not cross checking this time and believing everything she told me over the phone like no hidden charges etc.


this all happened 2 days ago and i have another interview lined up later today for a fairly good profile (no bpo/backend crap) after clearing an online test for it. it's the real deal and it'll give an okay start to a fresher like me.

i live in a 1rk on the top floor of a resident house, there are only 2 1rks on the top floor. a single bachelor girl is moving to 
one of the 1rks. my house owner (who occupied 2 floors) is now living on an other city, so its going to be only 2 of us in the entire building most of the time.

i am mostly scared of the worst possible scenario like any false accusations or any problems and with the law leaning towards women, will the society blame me ? i am a bachelor as well, this makes the problem even more scarier. i don't know any thing about that girl, but i am just in paranoia.

thank you.

update (after a week since the original post): she got to know manu had been drunk in his room and dropped to the floor along with his fridge and tomato'd his skull. she lived 4-5 days without knowing there was a dead body the next door. his brother / sister were here to clean up and perform the rituals over the weekend and they apologized to arushi for what she was put through and commended for having been brave (apparently they knew but didn't / couldn't do anything about it because reasons she didn't want to find out further). was not expecting that closure. thank you all for having suggested and helped us. we both individually went through all of the comments and must admit, that gave us a lot of mental support.",radjeep,going ur problem inspite many police rounds u got solution problem how stay mentally harrasemented situation she leave place go safe place live enjoy life as mental peace neceasary nowadays what legally person u alredy done so dont go deep wiser solution that old man nothing do ur frnd full life suugest girl waste precious time matter so better leave negativity shift focus well being,561,16,4.451154529307282,4.375,female friend harassed verbally perverts next door do friend living housing society kolkata let call arushi arushi sole occupant flat 4th floor floor neighbour drunk pervert 50 year old let call manu balconies windows two flats adjacent whatever loud enough manu flat audible arushi likes sit balcony yell curses initially random stuff he pissed language foulest imagine copulating mothers etc tried initiate conversations multiple times arushi she course avoided best could even spoke manu personally politely finds language excruciatingly foul requested that soon enough yelling cursing quickly descended expressing sexual desires cheapest ways imagine she even hesitates describe exact stuff says go hours end every day enough merry brand fellow perverts drunk flat come knock arushi door make things even difficult her eventually went police once left guy warning events continued went police second time cops came guy place left bit serious warning events continued the warnings seem effect him night scenario remained resume call cops came took drunks away back soon enough seemingly again left threats let loose sober back yet again events span duration 3 4 months obviously arushi feel safe live perpetual fear leave enter room come across douchebags drunk door left wide open since official police warnings effect even police seem care enough clueless this woman helplines reachout centers right talk to sort leads help appreciated thank you update after week since original post got know manu drunk room dropped floor along fridge tomato d skull lived 4 5 days without knowing dead body next door brother sister clean perform rituals weekend apologized arushi put commended brave apparently knew anything reasons want find further expecting closure thank suggested helped us individually went comments must admit gave us lot mental support

it doesn't matter if you agree or disagree with him. think about how much freedom is there if someone is just arrested trying to leave the country. and he didn't commit any actual crime. 

they will probably call make up a  terrorism charge or something. 

next they will be able to arrest absolutely anyone. after all the they can use the same fake reasons.

* i don't want to be hired for any service-based company. i've heard very bad reviews about them.
* due to intense depression and mental disorders (aspergers, adhd, and ocd), i forgot most of the stuff; and i can't focus well on even basic fundamentals. my brain hurts like hell!
* i can't solve leetcode problems or the ones on hackerrank and similar platforms: even the easy ones!
* also, there are a lot of things and so less time! i don't know how i wasted 4 years of engineering.
* the thing that haunts me the most is, no product-based company is gonna hire me seeing a 2-year gap and that i graduated from a private university. also, the competition is too much here (due to overpopulation).

also, honestly, all of us took a lot for granted, didn't we? we had normal lives. going out for dinner, fancy food, smokes, chai, hanging out with people, all of that.

feels like we really took our normal lives for granted and now that feels like a luxury. like personally if you ask me, if anyone ever makes plans again, i'm never saying no or canceling on them. i definitely am going to be grateful every single time i get to go out and hang out at the places i usually go to. i still have a regular supply of smoke and if i wanted, i could even get my greens. but it's not the same and it's not as fun as smoking at the tapri with a cutting chai in hand. 

also, i can't help but think about the regular faces i used to interact with on an almost daily basis while i didn't even know their names. you probably know people like that too. i really hope everyone makes it.

we just crossed a 1000, but i'm still hopeful. know why? because if the lock down was not in place the numbers would be much, much worse.

i regret this decision more than anything in my life.

i find many thing interesting, like designing stuffs, may it be posters, cars or anything. my parents and friends always used to say i have an artistic mind. i draw a lot too, good pictures also.

then i got into photography, i take a lot of photos and still do. have won 2-3 local photography contests. but never invested in it because i never got time to do so.

also i never knew how to get into this photography field? i don't know anything else than taking photos and posting them on social media for meaningless likes.

by photography i mean wildlife, landscape, etc. i wish to work for any established companies as their photographer. i really wont care about the salary very much as atleast i would love what i'm doing. the thought of sitting infront if a computer just drives me crazy everyday.

i need help and advice. do i need to complete degrees in photography to get into the field? please help me in anyway you can.

Science/Technology,endlessly refreshing for bigbasket delivery slots? created a cross-platform program to notify you whenever a delivery slot gets available in your area.,77,fzzcgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzzcgy/endlessly_refreshing_for_bigbasket_delivery_slots/,19,2020-04-13 05:36:03,"**live at**: https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier

**demo**: [demo](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gif?raw=true)

**detailed installing instructions**: [documentation](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier#installation)

---
this program gives you a system notification (cross-platform: windows, linux, os x) whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address.


- due to current pandemic crisis of covid-19: a severe lockdown has been placed in india such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them, bigbasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. however, due to the excess demand, delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address.



some of the key features includes:

1. cross platform system wide notifications.
1. you can login via otp all by the terminal itself.
1. ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once.
1. logging enabled by default for better debugging.
1. configuration flexibility regarding various options.
1. program doesn't do any javascript-rendering via headless browsers or anything.
1. polling is done via api endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability.


due to the current pandemic crisis of covid-19, i advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that aren't needed per se.

i have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems, however if you have any ideas to improve the section - feel free to send a pr.

the program is completely *open source*, such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at: [github](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier)

if you‚Äôve any issues in using program, or find any bugs or any other query contact me on twitter at: [@ugupta41](https://twitter.com/ugupta41/status/1249367355769016320)

a medical scientist researching infectious disease, for the us government in houston who was my classmates in college.

and our friendships are equally deep after his departure to america.

got a call from him.

his first sentence was,

""devendra ji,

* our pm modi is some great man, probably.

i said

""hey, he is, but what did he do now?""

he said, ""we have been doing research in india for the last 30 years on infectious disease, but this idea of 1 day curfew never came to our mind.""

i asked, ""are you also making fun of modi like seculars, leftists, muslims, thukde thukde gang, urban naxalites, award returning gangs, aap, ndtv etc in india?""

he said, ""oh nothing like that, i and my whole family have been citizens of america for 19 years, my annual salary is more than 15 crores in indian rupees, but the hearts are still indian.

every major step and decision of modi is completely separated from politics, i wish the welfare of india and human beings i also saw lakhs of indians are making fun of modi's 1 day self-imposed curfew, but in our laboratory, a 45-minute official meeting of all the big scientists has just been convened to discuss this announcement of modi.

you would be surprised, this 45-minute meeting lasted for more than 3 hours, with a 1-day self-imposed curfew to discuss contagious diseases and its impact on covid 19 in particular,

all scientists were of the opinion that, 12 hours is a very effective way to prevent the spread of corona virus by cutting every person from the world, because covid cannot survive for more than 12 hours on any surface outside the human body.

in such a situation, being cut off from the outside world, inanimate objects such as door handles, currency notes, files, courier parcels, steering wheels of vehicles viruses on pens etc. will be completely eliminated, and without spending a single penny in this manner as suggested by modi, since there is no loss of work due to sunday,

* the country will be almost free from viruses! * these ideas were not thought of in the minds of the world's highest level scientists of this subject

if any of his advisors has given this advice to modi then this person is entitled to the nobel prize, and if the great idea is the brainchild of modi, then he should get the nobel prize for medicine for his contribution in the medical field of infectious disease. ""*

i could not even speak a word.

here, crores of people of my country are making fun of modi, humiliating him as illiterate,

as seen above, revealing options in select dropdowns requires special tricks. and input fields actually trigger sidebars (or dropdown?) in an already cramped box. form generally follows function, but seems like the developers at [finacle](https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/corporate-banks/) were more concerned with adding wave effect to the buttons, and slide transition to menus than actually testing their rubbish. i'd give another fifteen instances of atrocious ui, but you get the gist.

if they can't even get the easier parts of writing a web app right, i wonder what sort of nightmare realm exists on the back-end.

there's of course the trend of forcing users to update their passwords every quarter or so. do you append a number to your password and increment it? well, most do, which is why it's such a shit form of security, and [advised against by nist](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-faq/#q-b05). i feel for the non-tech-savvy folks who are probably writing their passwords down somewhere instead of using a manager. some banks double down and require separate sign in and transaction passwords, each with its own rules, naturally.

looking for a change in job around start of 2021, and colleagues recommended bangalore just because it has a lot more opportunities (in the category i'd be looking for) and should be my choice above ncr. some of them have already been there and mostly came here for their families and advice me so.

here's what i pay for in noida -

rent for 3 bhk (larger living area) - 18000, 6 kms from office, takes 20 minutes to reach in \~150 rupee split among two people per side for uber. electricity is cheap. gas pipeline is way cheaper than cylinders used at homes.

***by: kartikeya semwal***

with the ever-increasing threat posed by china‚Äôs pla navy in the ioc (indian ocean region), neighbouring countries like japan, south korea and australia have started feeling the need to induct and operate aircraft carriers of their own. till now, none of these countries has an operational aircraft carrier (ac). instead, they operate heli-carriers and/or als (amphibious landing ships).

[ins vikramaditya in action.](https://preview.redd.it/u5vc03vjdtq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ec478ae1ee8c7168dd6a52a2661b63d558e849)

but more than them, india feels the immediate need of operating at least 3 aircraft carriers (acs). currently, indian navy has a solo ac called ins vikramaditya, a 44,000-tonne behemoth brought from russia. by 2022, india will get its 2nd ac which is its own indigenous ac called ins vikrant; a 45,000-tonne ship. now since india has a vast coastline to guard, it needs 1 ac fleet to guard its western coasts & another to guard its eastern coast. 

[india's indigenous aircraft carrier ins vikrant.](https://preview.redd.it/47yvk30ndtq41.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06ee4482729026193a3c104ff4877b688eafedca)

guarding the western coast is easy when compared to the eastern coast as our foe pakistan doesn‚Äôt have an ac of its own. opposite to that, china currently has 2 acs namely laoning & shandong, the later of which was inducted towards the end of 2019. with this, china‚Äôs power projection through it‚Äôs pla navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including india. china is working on getting 2 more acs by 2030 so that it can get under control the whole of ioc. till date, ioc has been guarded by india navy in coordination with japanese & south korean navy. 

[pla navy ac shandong.](https://preview.redd.it/eihzzbdtetq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9422349c9d4eb3ed67cd560e87974a0fc4756f8b)

indian navy‚Äôs top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of pla navy & to effectively guard the ioc region, it needs a 3rd ac which if accepted by govt. of india (goi); will be india‚Äôs 2nd indigenous ac called ins vishal, a bigger 65,000 tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch. the only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore. due to this reason, goi is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a 3rd ac for indian navy.

[india-australia navy officers.](https://preview.redd.it/2j33mhp2ftq41.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8816ed265fbf0ff76f302bdbb30c51dc5f26675)

but there might be a solution to this problem, and that is sharing an ac jointly by 4 nations namely india, australia, japan & south korea. indian can have a 40% share in its ownership while the remaining 3 countries can have 20% each. this will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all 4 countries. i am hereby sharing the following points about it:-it can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. this can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

1. having a joint ac will reduce its overall cost including construction & maintenance & bring it down to 1/4th for each country. 

2. it can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. this can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

3. each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as japan for its electrical & electronic parts, australia and south korea for their weapon packages & crew and india for its expertise in hull & designing. 

4. since it will be constructed by 4 countries jointly, it can be the best ac built till date as will have the best of features from 4 different countries. 

5. a huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all 4 countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany & guard it; which will comprise of missile cruisers, frigates, destroyers, submarines & supply ship/s. 

6. joint operations & functioning that will further cement international ties between all 4 south asian countries. that will also include sharing of knowledge among officers & sailors. 

7. automatic threat-neutralisation from china‚Äôs pla navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint ac as doing so will bring it to war against 4 countries of which 2 are developed & 2 are developing economies. 

  

[f-35 b taking off from us aircraft carrier.](https://preview.redd.it/oabivtx7ftq41.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1b8219f54d772f967fde8ea127edcbecc0112f8)

one point that can be decided later is- the type of aircraft that will operate from it. now, this can be the latest 5th generation stealth fighters such as lockheed martin‚Äôs f-35bs or the 4+ generation boeing‚Äôs f/a-18 super hornet block-iii. now except india, all 3 countries have already ordered f-35as for their airforce‚Äô modernization plans. so they can easily get the f-35bs which have been specially designed to be operated from acs. 

but again, doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint ac which in-turn won‚Äôt be feasible. add to it, while the other 3 countries are also nato members, us won‚Äôt be willing to allow access of f-35bs with indian navy officers & sailors on the ac as it will help them get the technical and mechanical know-how of f-35bs, which they might share with iaf, drdo & hal to help them make their own 5th generation amca (advanced medium combat aircraft). 

[f\/a-18 super hornet. ](https://preview.redd.it/xxbclpdeftq41.jpg?width=384&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89250ac8e3e72e6a7d76e5b328f456b62877f469)

on the other hand, opting for f/a-18 super hornet block-iii would be a cost-efficient step and will be welcomed by one and all. the us won‚Äôt mind sharing of technical & mechanical know-how about their latest variant of 4+ generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to indian navy and indian airforce for their respective requirements of 57 jets and 114 jets respectively. indian navy‚Äôs fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of super hornets as it will also get them 1st hand experience of flying these beasts.

now it only depends on the top leadership of all 4 countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not, to effectively check the chinese threat in ioc. it is only a matter of time coz once if pla navy gets its 3rd ac possibly by 2025, then they might not be willing to back down. but if india, japan, australia and south korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint ac & a joint strike group along with it together by 2025-26 then china would think twice before messing with it.",ReadwithKartikeya,statue earned 82 51 crore 1 year opening much worried statues ask chorgress party

if crores of people install it, just using wireless heahphones is enough to track your location.

it picks up bluetooth signals that it comes in contact with. so even if the person standing next to you has this installed, and you don't have your bluetooth hidden, your location is noted and added to the social graph.

the account creation process was already slow due to chaining proxies but then it was pretty slow to verify captcha each time! but it is doable. you need to setup proxy-chains on kali linux and configure it using tor's random proxies and then you are kind of done for the network anonymity but then comes the challenge of actually assuming an identity. you have to avoid all the general personal traits while creating the accounts. i chose proton mail for the email client but still it asked for a verification using mobile number! this step took a lot of time as i had to get a phone number which cannot be traced to me but well lets say it was taken care of. after you have a mail id set up and ready to go, you can pretty much get going on to sites which does not require a personal verification using some kind of mobile number. i think authenticator apps can work but i do not have a spare phone which i can load a foss os on so that step is missing.

it is definitely doable, but you have to be very careful just in case you accidentally reveal some important info regarding yourself. this should help any one trying to get her or his word out and are kind of in a fix due to their identity being in a crisis. i would encourage people to be anonymous but be genuine, which is a hard thing to ask for given the anonymity! kind of a see saw in my opinion, one always goes down when the other comes up. trust and anonymity that is.

for those who treat reddit like a social media: yes i have negative karma due to one comment which i posted, but then reddit karma isn't my doing, its all of you in the community!

Science/Technology,who findings after trip to china - 5% of people who are diagnosed with covid require artificial respiration. another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. we indians are so fucked if this gets here!,42,fbxmmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fbxmmt/who_findings_after_trip_to_china_5_of_people_who/,17,2020-03-02 07:19:23,"the who has sent a team of international experts to china to investigate the situation, including clifford lane, clinical director at the us national institutes of health. here is the press conference on youtube and the final report of the commission as pdf after they visited beijing, wuhan, shenzhen, guangzhou and chengdu. here are some interesting facts about covid that i have not yet read in the media:

when a cluster of several infected people occurred in china, it was most often (78-85%) caused by an infection within the family by droplets and other carriers of infection in close contact with an infected person. transmission by fine aerosols in the air over long distances is not one of the main causes of spread. most of the 2,055 infected hospital workers were either infected at home or in the early phase of the outbreak in wuhan when hospital safeguards were not raised yet.

5% of people who are diagnosed with covid require artificial respiration. another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. the duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). the mass and duration of the treatments overburdened the existing health care system in wuhan many times over. the province of hubei, whose capital is wuhan, had 65,596 infected persons so far. a total of 40,000 employees were sent to hubei from other provinces to help fight the epidemic. 45 hospitals in wuhan are caring for covid patients, 6 of which are for patients in critical condition and 39 are caring for seriously ill patients and for infected people over the age of 65. two makeshift hospitals with 2,600 beds were built within a short time. 80% of the infected have mild disease, ten temporary hospitals were set up in gymnasiums and exhibition halls for those.

china can now produce 1.6 million test kits for the novel coronavirus per week. the test delivers a result on the same day. across the country, anyone who goes to the doctor with a fever is screened for the virus: in guangdong province, far from wuhan, 320,000 people have been tested, and 0.14% of those were positive for the virus.

the vast majority of those infected sooner or later develop symptoms. cases of people in whom the virus has been detected and who do not have symptoms at that time are rare - and most of them fall ill in the next few days.

the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). running nose is not a symptom of covid.

an examination of 44,672 infected people in china showed a fatality rate of 3.4%. fatality is strongly influenced by age, pre-existing conditions, gender, and especially the response of the health care system. all fatality figures reflect the state of affairs in china up to 17 february, and everything could be quite different in the future elsewhere.

healthcare system: 20% of infected people in china needed hospital treatment for weeks. china has hospital beds to treat 0.4% of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1% and 1.3% and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases. the most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds (including material and personnel) until there is enough for the seriously ill. china also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. thanks to this response, the fatality rate in china is now lower than a month ago.

pre-existing conditions: the fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in china was 13.2%. it was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (uncontrolled diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.

age: the younger you are, the less likely you are to be infected and the less likely you are to fall seriously ill if you do get infected:

table placeholder 

read: of those infected in china, 8.1% were between 20 and 29 years old (this does not mean that 8.1% of people between 20 and 29 become infected). of those infected in this age group, 0.2% died.

gender: women catch the disease just as often as men. but only 2.8% of chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. the disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. in 9 examined births of infected women, the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. the women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. what effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.

the new virus is genetically 96% identical to a known coronavirus in bats and 86-92% identical to a coronavirus in pangolin. therefore, the transmission of a mutated virus from animals to humans is the most likely cause of the appearance of the new virus.

since the end of january, the number of new coronavirus diagnoses in china has been steadily declining (shown here as a graph) with now only 329 new diagnoses within the last day - one month ago it was around 3,000 a day. ""this decline in covid-19 cases across china is real,"" the report says. the authors conclude this from their own experience on site, declining hospital visits in the affected regions, the increasing number of unoccupied hospital beds, and the problems of chinese scientists to recruit enough newly infected for the clinical studies of the numerous drug trials. here is the relevant part of the press conference about the decline assessment.

one of the important reasons for containing the outbreak is that china is interviewing all infected people nationwide about their contact persons and then tests those. there are 1,800 teams in wuhan to do this, each with at least 5 people. but the effort outside of wuhan is also big. in shenzhen, for example, the infected named 2,842 contact persons, all of whom were found, testing is now completed for 2,240, and 2.8% of those had contracted the virus. in sichuan province, 25,493 contact persons were named, 25,347 (99%) were found, 23,178 have already been examined and 0.9% of them were infected. in the province of guangdong, 9,939 contacts were named, all found, 7,765 are already examined and 4.8% of them were infected. that means: if you have direct personal contact with an infected person, the probability of infection is between 1% and 5%.

finally, a few direct quotes from the report:

""china‚Äôs bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. in the face of a previously unknown virus, china has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. china‚Äôs uncompromising and rigorous use of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the covid-19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response. this rather unique and unprecedented public health response in china reversed the escalating cases in both hubei, where there has been widespread community transmission, and in the importation provinces, where family clusters appear to have driven the outbreak.""

""much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain covid-19 in china. these are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize transmission chains in humans. fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases, very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts, and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures.""

""covid-19 is spreading with astonishing speed; covid-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences; and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. however, to reduce covid-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. these measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.""",Silverballers47,trying say refer bhakts streets support them fighting religion apparently support

i've gone through a lot of technical details between the roland fp10 and the yamaha p-125 from past month now (quarantining my ass off on this comparisons)  
i know the fp-30 is a better choice but the prices here in india...i think i'll have to sell a kidney to buy the roland. its stupidly high !.  
roland   fp-30 - goes for rs. 72,824 or $952.96   
roland   fp-10 - goes for rs. 59,973 or $784.79  
yamaha p-125 - goes for rs. 53,189 or $696.02 

i know the digital sounds can easily be replaced after doing the midi wizardry (im a soft dev so i can handle those technicalities easily later) and by the looks of it both the rolands above have tri sensor keys which will yield much better midi data in case i do decide to swap out the sounds for (post processing? i dont know the right term for this). thats why i prefer the rolands for now and ofcourse because of their action (no i haven't tried them yet, because guess what, noone even has them on display here in the entire state).

my questions  
1 - yamaha or roland - which will age better? (lot of roland youtube videos complaining about loud keynoise after 4-6 months of usage while yamaha has no complains on the same). im planing to use this keyboard untill it fails to work or dies on me 7+ years easily.

2- is that price tag justifiable for roland? i mean should i pay 100$ + just for the 3 key sensors ? 

3-i want to be able to learn complex arrangements of classical music later on (like beethoven - moonlight sonata (3rd movement)) which should also be fine on yamaha right?

3- do the rolands in india have bluetooth connectivity ? most indian sites say ""does not come with bluetooth"" which i sort of need. anyone in india purchased this?  
4- can i just use an addon accessory via the usb to host to transmit the bluetooth data to my computer? because in this case i can then get the yamaha and purchase the accessory.",shriommanerker,sadhyak full band noones picking calls tried already ll hopefully visit lockdown ends pick keyboard spot available mostly furtados itself,370,11,4.303030303030303,5.909090909090909,roland fp10 fp30 price bluetooth functionality compared usa goa im looking purchase digital piano ve gone lot technical details roland fp10 yamaha p 125 past month quarantining ass comparisons know fp 30 better choice prices think ll sell kidney buy roland stupidly high roland fp 30 goes rs 72 824 952 96 roland fp 10 goes rs 59 973 784 79 yamaha p 125 goes rs 53 189 696 02 know digital sounds easily replaced midi wizardry im soft dev handle technicalities easily later looks rolands tri sensor keys yield much better midi data case decide swap sounds post processing dont know right term this thats prefer rolands ofcourse action no tried yet guess what noone even display entire state questions 1 yamaha roland age better lot roland youtube videos complaining loud keynoise 4 6 months usage yamaha complains same im planing use keyboard untill fails work dies 7 years easily price tag justifiable roland mean pay 100 3 key sensors 3 want able learn complex arrangements classical music later beethoven moonlight sonata 3rd movement fine yamaha right 3 rolands bluetooth connectivity sites say does come bluetooth sort need anyone purchased this 4 use addon accessory via usb host transmit bluetooth data computer case yamaha purchase accessory

i have a dedicated server with godaddy that i use to host simple wordpress sites. one day i randomly decided to log into the server to check one of the sites and realized that i was unable to access the hosting. after sometime with tech support i was able to log in only to realize that my entire data was wiped clean. at first, the tech support tried to blame this to some ""hacking"" incident but when i kept asking for details such as the method of hacking, ip addresses used and other info, they reluctantly opened a support ticket. a day later they came back with a response saying that there was a problem with the server and they were moving the data which they lost somehow. they lost 25 sites that were hosted and didn't even offer an apology.

i called tech support again and they said that it was my fault for not keeping backups. when i asked for a refund for the hosting let alone the loss of data, the customer service representative asked me not to act ""smart"" as they are not responsible for anything.

the tweet:

the article:
https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/ancient-fire-ritual-has-positive-impact-on-environment-scientists/article2103881.ece#

in this, a guy named prof vpn nampoori is said to have been researching on an ancient vedic ritual called ""athirathram"" which he claimed germinates seeds at a much faster rate, etc. he said:

> ‚Äúthe findings would not only help dispel superstitious notions associated with vedic rituals but also help in continuation of such tradition for the betterment of nature and the environment,‚Äù says nampoori.

this didn't sit right with me, so i went to google to search on this. being a fan of a youtuber potholer54, i wanted to get some research papers, not media articles. and as i suspected, i found none. even in his own profile in his university, there is no such study. i searched his linkedin, researchacademy, etc but didn't find anything (i may have missed something, its possible). rather i found this:

this news article accuses him of fudging data. i further found this:

Science/Technology,google pixel quality control and the scam pertaining to after sales service by conducted by b2x,9,fkvenf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fkvenf/google_pixel_quality_control_and_the_scam/,0,2020-03-19 08:53:46,"dear readers,

in early 2017 i created a post on reddit which was something like- think hard before getting a pixel in india, after having nightmarish experience with htc service centre. now after almost three years, i am creating this topic, which will show you what i meant then, give it more substance and additionally will reflect what scam is being conducted by its third party service provider namely b2x. kindly take the time to read it in full.

‚Ä¢ may, 2017: i purchased a google pixel xl from flipkart effectively for rs. 43,499 (price was rs. 53,499 but there was a ridiculous exchange offer of rs. 10,000 on asus zenfone 5).

‚Ä¢ july-august, 2019: the phone was running fine during this period of 2 years 2 months but suddenly the microphone crapped out. obviously the tech world was already known with google pixel 2016 infamous microphone issue which google themselves acknowledged and with respective lawsuits affected users are getting up to usd 500 refund in the us. anyhow, i called support and they arranged a pickup and afterwards i received a service charge quotation of rs. 3,251 from b2x. i initially rejected to pay, as the issue is acknowledged by google and proven as a hardware defect. but their team lead somehow sweet talked me out of it, sir, we will also change the motherboard of the device within that cost and so on. so i paid the amount.

i receive the phone back, expecting it to repaired and extremely tensed that they might have put scratches on it, as mine was in immaculate condition even after two years of usage, i unpack the fedex box and shocked! that's not my phone. a phone which is wrapped in plastic sheet and 'looked like a brand new device', of 128 gb no less. i was over the moon for like an hour. it was totally discharged. i charged it and turned it on and found it was running the nougat firmware still. whatever, i started using it in full cheerful state. google customer support zindabaad.

update: google customer support sent me a email dated 23 mar, 2020, acknowledging that the replacement device they sent me back in august, 2019 was indeed a factory-tested device, worth of rs. 17,999 only. so nutshell is- without even informing me they sent me a refurbished device. fantastic. 

‚Ä¢ december, 2019: not even four month passes, and this replacement device now has a broken vibration module out of the blue. vibration is the only mode i use on my phones so i couldn't ignore it. called google support again, another pick up and this time b2x quoted me a service charge of rs. 1,539, in which the actual hardware costed like 400 rupees only and the rest was there service charge with tax, lol. anyway, i paid it.

https://i.imgur.com/iwdv7eo.png

‚Ä¢ january, 2020: less than a month passes by, the vibration motor is dead again. i said ok google, assistant doesn't trigger, no kidding......i called the support again and another pickup was conducted and this time they repaired the vibration module for free. as they didn't have any other option as it was within 30 days from last service.

‚Ä¢ 04th march, 2020: it has been 20 odd days since the last service, now the phone at one fine morning suddenly died on me. i mean i was watching a linus video or something, and it just rebooted once, pops up on homescreen and then totally goes blank. i was pretty sure the battery crapped up or something. but no, it never turned back on, no matter what i tried. so i do the obvious, call google support again and yet another pick up and now the main point, this time around b2x has initially quoted me a service charge of rs. 25,104 (rupees twenty five thousand one hundred and four only). i was what? then someone calls me over phone and tells me there is a discount on this and the revised service charge will be of rs. 21,724. i said outright to him that i will not be paying a single penny and i will be initiating legal steps.

https://i.imgur.com/lhfiog9.png

to sum up; i have paid rs. 43,499 for a pixel xl in may, 2017. the device then crapped up with the infamous microphone issue which is google's own manufacturing defect and the same acknowledged two years down the line, i paid rs. 3,251 for it. in return which i received a device 'looked like a new phone'. barely four months pass, the vibrator failed, for which i paid rs. 1,539. then the vibrator fails again, no charge this time. so a total of rs. 4,800 down the drain for service charge only. and now, then want me to pay rs. 21,724 rupees, to repair my phone as motherboard replacement cost. 

justify this, you pay rs. 50,000 (original price plus service charge) and then in the end you have a dead device and to make it un-dead b2x/ google wants rs. 21,724.  i have already emailed them, tweeted them but no reply, yet, and their sugar coated replies by the customer service are made in a way to lure you in, like before sending in the phone this time, they assured me, sir, this time the problem will be completely taken care of and you will have no problems in the future whatsoever. and this is them taking care of the problem. i am certain there is no connection between the customer care and b2x. b2x runs its own dirty games, either with or without google's connivance.

this post was created to gain traction, that is it. no other purpose it is meant for. i really don't want to hear opinions about how chinese oneplus minus or meme company phones are better, i am not into those, i will never be. so anyone caring about pixels, the camera and the software experience (which is hands down sublime, but still outdone totally by the pathetic hardware quality control) kindly do me a favour. vote this post up, so that it can be seen by as many people as possible and share this post in other places if you kindly. also, if there are other places where i can post this topic which will gain more traction kindly advise me of the same, i will be grateful to you.

this is what the [font manager shows](https://i.imgur.com/cyg0ivj.png) / [fails to show](https://i.imgur.com/bxmlpll.png). and this applies to all indic fonts - devnagari, telugu, kannada, bengali etc

tried using various fonts as defaults, no difference.
in windows, the same fonts look beautiful using the same font/character encoding settings in browsers.

edit: fonts suck on other apps too like telegram and other system apps. i also tried using segoe ui systemwide but doesn't help.

edit 2: i was able to fix fonts in firefox but not on brave. on firefox it was a browser issue/bug (i already had selected proper fonts for each language).

probably dejavu and free sans are going to be default font. they are okay but replace them with noto (or lohit), more readable. if they are not preinstalled then [get them from here.](https://www.google.com/get/noto/)

edit 3: i applied nirmala ui from windows. i was trying to use segoe ui from windows. nirmala ui has glyphs of segoe ui + glyphs from devanagari, bengali, gurmukhi, gujarati, oriya, tamil, telugu, kannada, malayalam & sinhala. it gives a bit windows-esque feeling but everything is consistent and easy to read. telegram is crashing so not sure about that but all other apps have better readability now.

here is what i know about it -> it allows any one to mine coins (or pi to be precise) via a mobile app (ios and android). so unlike other crypto currency, you do not need massive computing power to mine and participate in the project.

it has been developed by three standford phds. it is still in beta phase so you need to be invited by a member (see end of article).

i went on to verify the identity of the three founders and found the following:

here was a message from one of the team members on the pi in app chat.

‚Äúthree of the core members of the team are stanford graduates. i am a grad from stanford‚Äôs graduate school of business. the others two are stanford phds (who taught a blockchain development course at stanford). we are trying to be deliberate about how we introduce ourselves to the community. appreciate your patience with us while we work on team page, intros etc.‚Äù

i therefore went on the stanford center for blockchain research website (https://cbr.stanford.edu/) to check if it was true and found that

1. vince mcphillip who is on that team member list. from his linkedin page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentmcphillip).
2. nicholas kokkalis who is also on the https://blockchaincollective.io/ and is listed as a stanford phd on his linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kokkalis/)
3. chengdiao fan who is a stanford phd, i found her link from nicholas‚Äôs linkedin page.

this i believe confirms the stanford university link and lends more credibility to the team, and that was deeply reassuring because it means they have

a) a deep understanding on the subject and

b) they also have an unlimited supply of students to pick from to contribute to the project.

Science/Technology,iaf says ‚Äì ‚Äúready for a 2-front war‚Äù. really?,11,erww88,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/erww88/iaf_says_ready_for_a_2front_war_really/,5,2020-01-22 05:52:14,"*by: kartikeya semwal* 

it is good to see that iaf (indian airforce) is working hard to move from strength to strength by acquiring different types of fighter planes, transport aircrafts and different types helicopters. but this doesn‚Äôt mean that it is ready to fight any type of war, especially when it is about fighting a two-front war on western and eastern fronts. though iaf has been carrying out war games, operational exercises, joint exercises with friendly countries but it doesn‚Äôt mean that it is ready and well equipped for a two-front war. 

the most important point is still the same- lack of enough jet fighters to complete full squadron-strength of 45. we all know that the last of mig-21s were retired a few months back in 2019 that had brought down iaf‚Äôs squadron strength to 33. but recently, with retiring of mig-27 3rd generation fighters lovingly called ‚Äúbahadur‚Äù by iaf, the current squadron strength is down to a dangerous low of 28. and if that was not enough then here me out loud- iaf intends to retire upgraded jaguars and mig-29s in the next 10 years. 

&#x200b;

[mig-27 or \\""bahadur\\"" of iaf in action. ](https://preview.redd.it/6k50itvjm5c41.jpg?width=647&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaa407e1c20598e7d4a17f462363e2a915457298)

so iaf‚Äôs statement of ‚Äúwe are ready to fight a two-front war‚Äù completely undermines itself. no doubt our air force chief and our brave pilots are patriotic and ready for challenges, but that doesn‚Äôt works when it comes to fighting a war. numbers do matter, especially when you have a neighbour like china which is continuously upgrading its armed forces. china‚Äôs pla-airforce is working night & day to add over 600 aircrafts including fighter jets in the next decade (10 years). most of these are combat jets and are of 4th and 5th generation. not to mention the j-10, j-15, j-20 and j-31. 

&#x200b;

[from top left to right: j-10, j-15, j-20 & j-31    ](https://preview.redd.it/yqaxuhuzm5c41.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ab367f8aa1963a0b870c41f34dafe1cbe2ad915)

once they get those number of fighters up and flying, they will gain control over not just all of asia but also over the pacific region, which is of great importance for sea-trade, international business and rich in resources. now we all know that iaf is acquiring 40 tejas mk-1 fighters followed by 43 tejas mk-1as totalling to 83 combat jets of 4th generation. there have been talks about iaf might buy 114 tejas mk-ii or mwf but when & in how many years? even if we consider that they will do so in the next 10 years, but is that enough? not at all.

rafale considered as 4.5+ generation fighter that has the calibre to take out 5th generation fighters of china (j-20 & j-31) are being acquired by iaf but only 36, and that too only by 2026. now the question arises- what it china attacks india in the next 1-3 years?

the answer is, if that happens iaf will be doomed. now it is clear that action is needed & at a fast pace. the one and only solution to increase the number of iaf‚Äôs fighting squadrons to take on a two-front war & ‚Äòfight will full force‚Äô is- ask hal to increase the production of lca tejas jets & buy at least 5-6 squadrons (80 to 98) of a new jet. but if they don‚Äôt want to buy it then they should at least take the same number of fighter planes on lease for the next 10 years. iaf has already zeroed in on saab‚Äôs gripen e & boeing‚Äôs f/a-18 super hornet block-iii. both are on par with each other and both are 4.5 generation fighters. getting any one of them will not only improve iaf‚Äôs firepower, but it will also make up the numbers and nullify the psychological advantage china‚Äôs pla airforce has over us.

&#x200b;

 meanwhile, india can continue design-development & production of tejas mk-ii or the mwf (medium weight fighter) that will be a 4th+ generation twin-engine fighter and will form the backbone of iaf in future. they are already carrying out induction of tejas mk-1s & mk-1as but that too needs to be speeded up to improve the numbers. if i were to choose, i would go for super hornet block-iii. my reasons are simple, 

1. it will bring a whole new set of technologies, hardwares, softwares, missiles and ammunition. india will also get access to much-needed powerful engine & its technology that hal, drdo & ada have failed to make on their own over the years. 

2. also, super hornet is battle-proven & its war-fighting abilities are unknown to both pakistan & china. 

3. another reason is that this fighter jet is not present in either asia or in the pacific region. thus, giving an advantage to iaf and disadvantage to china coz they don‚Äôt know much about it. 

4. one more reason is that it is cost-effective and iaf pilots have already flown & tested it and are satisfied with its performance.  

5. last but not least. india can buy 2 super hornets for the price of 1 rafale fighter jet being offered by france. so the numbers do matter. 

if this happens, then iaf will actually ‚Äòbe ready & fit‚Äô to fight a two-front war if needed. now i leave it up to all of you reading this article as to what should be done to address the problem of iaf‚Äôs depleting squadrons so they can match our eastern enemy. feel free to comment below.",ReadwithKartikeya,thanks bro whatever mean upvote please describe,911,9,5.045901639344263,4.111111111111111,iaf says ready front war really by kartikeya semwal good see iaf airforce working hard move strength strength acquiring different types fighter planes transport aircrafts different types helicopters doesn t mean ready fight type war especially fighting two front war western eastern fronts though iaf carrying war games operational exercises joint exercises friendly countries doesn t mean ready well equipped two front war important point still same lack enough jet fighters complete full squadron strength 45 know last mig 21s retired months back 2019 brought iaf squadron strength 33 recently retiring mig 27 3rd generation fighters lovingly called bahadur iaf current squadron strength dangerous low 28 enough loud iaf intends retire upgraded jaguars mig 29s next 10 years x200b mig 27 bahadur iaf action preview redd 6k50itvjm5c41 jpg width 647 format pjpg auto webp eaa407e1c20598e7d4a17f462363e2a915457298 iaf statement we ready fight two front war completely undermines itself doubt air force chief brave pilots patriotic ready challenges doesn t works comes fighting war numbers matter especially neighbour china continuously upgrading armed forces china pla airforce working night day add 600 aircrafts including fighter jets next decade 10 years combat jets 4th 5th generation mention j 10 j 15 j 20 j 31 x200b from top left right j 10 j 15 j 20 j 31 preview redd yqaxuhuzm5c41 jpg width 550 format pjpg auto webp 7ab367f8aa1963a0b870c41f34dafe1cbe2ad915 number fighters flying gain control asia pacific region great importance sea trade international business rich resources know iaf acquiring 40 tejas mk 1 fighters followed 43 tejas mk 1as totalling 83 combat jets 4th generation talks iaf might buy 114 tejas mk ii mwf many years even consider next 10 years enough all x200b above lca tejas tejas mk ii mwf concept design preview redd pcxo7karn5c41 jpg width 550 format pjpg auto webp bd90c5372ab0246e05890c06724efb0a92d9ac4b rafale considered 4 5 generation fighter calibre take 5th generation fighters china j 20 j 31 acquired iaf 36 2026 question arises china attacks next 1 3 years answer is happens iaf doomed clear action needed fast pace solution increase number iaf fighting squadrons take two front war fight full force is ask hal increase production lca tejas jets buy least 5 6 squadrons 80 98 new jet don t want buy least take number fighter planes lease next 10 years iaf already zeroed saab gripen e boeing f 18 super hornet block iii par 4 5 generation fighters getting improve iaf firepower make numbers nullify psychological advantage china pla airforce us x200b f 18 super hornet block iii offered preview redd 6a5h8hbdo5c41 jpg width 739 format pjpg auto webp a4a4aa08ea284e27a6b4d6227bfa40073af74b8f meanwhile continue design development production tejas mk ii mwf medium weight fighter 4th generation twin engine fighter form backbone iaf future already carrying induction tejas mk 1s mk 1as needs speeded improve numbers choose would go super hornet block iii reasons simple 1 bring whole new set technologies hardwares softwares missiles ammunition access much needed powerful engine technology hal drdo ada failed make years super hornet battle proven war fighting abilities unknown pakistan china 3 another reason fighter jet present either asia pacific region thus giving advantage iaf disadvantage china coz don t know much 4 reason cost effective iaf pilots already flown tested satisfied performance 5 last least buy super hornets price 1 rafale fighter jet offered france numbers matter happens iaf actually be ready fit fight two front war needed leave reading article done address problem iaf depleting squadrons match eastern enemy feel free comment below

you are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. you do not matter. but what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


but, you are here in the now. you are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. so why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. there is no god, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. but there is this universe, where we all exist. religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the spanish flu look like a minor common cold. just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. none of your religions are without blood in your hands. all of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. and none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **false prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. we are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  what determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 a little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as modern humans in africa. we learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. we left africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 ¬∞c wherein iron started to melt from the ore. with this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. we made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. these technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. and then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. in less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. the modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. but this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the stone age. 


leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. we are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. as we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Politics,"there's something very fishy going on with covid-19 testing kits in india. prima facie, it reeks of corruption & favoritism in a pandemic.",1003,fnfnh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnfnh1/theres_something_very_fishy_going_on_with_covid19/,160,2020-03-23 20:32:23,"on 20th march, 18 firms got permission from govt. to get their testing kits validated by national institute of virology.

meanwhile, a day earlier on 19th, gujarat-based firm cosara had already received an approval to start manufacturing covid-19 test kits. this firm is a collaboration between a us-based company & an ahmedabad-based firm.

cosara's kits already have us fda approval.

some of the other 18 firms who were waiting to get their covid-19 test kits validated said that these would be sold at a price of 400-500 per kit (far cheaper than imported ones). 

cosara, on the other hand, refused to publicly divulge the cost of their covid-19 kits.

suddenly, on 21st march, the health ministry issued guidelines allowing private labs to conduct covid-19 tests. the cost of these is capped at a whopping 4500 rupees.

these guidelines have one caveat - only testing kits approved by us fda/european ce can be used.

that means only kits manufactured by ahmedabad-based cosara can be used for covid-19 testing.

so after allowing 18 firms to test their kits for production, the modi govt. suddenly changed guidelines to favor only 1 ahmedabad company (whose testing kit cost is unknown).

why is a gujarat-based firm being provided a monopoly on covid-19 testing kits by suddenly tweaking guidelines overnight?

why are 18 firms who can produce testing kits for very cheap prices being blocked by these sudden new guidelines? 

i've (saket gokhale) filed an rti to get more info.

update: now the health ministry in its press conference today has said, that us fda and eu ce approval aren't mandatory. so, now roche and cosara are two companies who have the nod from them to manufacture and sell test kits. but the question remains why they haven't validated others as well. either reject their application or accept it, why sit on it when test kits are badly needed.

times like this makes me value dr. manmohan singh. he would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. a party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. a finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. a home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. if he can murder muslims, he can watch hindus die too - a murderer is a murderer). a history graduate in rbi with a wet noodle for a spine. a society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


dr. singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. i hope the bjp, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a pr firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like congress, tmc, cpim, aap which have quite a bit of expertise by indian political standards. i hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

an order issued on march 27 shows that these vehicles of uttarakhand transport were sent directly to gujarat *under the instructions of the chief minister's office*. their purpose was to bring the people of gujarat trapped in haridwar to their homes. **while returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the uttarakhand government.**

workers from uttarakhand (working in ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home.

mukesh kumar says- ""the next morning, on march 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. we were 13 companions a bus. **the driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to rishikesh.** we found it strange but we had no choice. we were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. we thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. but that didn't happen either.

it is being said that all these people from gujarat had reached haridwar to participate in some religious ritual. these people are supposedly close to the prime minister and the home minister. **it is also clear from the official statement of ashwani kumar, secretary to the chief minister of gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the home minister directly.**

>prime minister of india 

>dear prime minister, i would like to convey to you my solidarity along with that of millions of congress party workers at this time of immense humanitarian crisis. we are all doing our utmost to cooperate with the steps the government is taking to fight the coronavirus outbreak in india. 

>the world has been forced to take immediate, severe measures to contain the rapid spread of the covid-19 virus and india is currently in the midst of a three-week lockdown. i must urge you to seriously consider the potentially devastating impact a nationwide lockdown would have on our people, our society and our economy. 

>it is critical for us to understand that india's conditions are unique. we may be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy. the number of poor people in india who are dependent on a daily income is simply too large for us to unilaterally shut down all economic activity. the consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from the covid-19 virus. 

>it is important that the government consider a more nuanced and targeted approach that takes the complex realities of our people into consideration. our priority must be to protect and isolate the elderly and vulnerable from the virus and to clearly and strongly communicate to the young the dangers of their proximity to older people.

> millions of india‚Äôs elderly live in villages. a complete lockdown and the resulting shut down of our economic engine will almost certainly ensure that millions of unemployed youth rush back to their villages, increasing the risk of infecting their parents, grandparents and the elderly population. this will result in a catastrophic loss of life. 

>we must immediately strengthen the social safety net and use every public resource we have to support and shelter the working poor. the financial package announced by the government is a good first step. but speedy delivery of the package is important. please announce and enforce a clear roadmap with dates for its implementation. large population centres will require equally large, dedicated hospitals with thousands of beds and ventilators. it is critical that we start setting up these structures and manufacturing the necessary equipment as fast as is humanly possible. at the same time, we need to dramatically increase the number of tests that we are carrying out and get an accurate picture of the virus‚Äôs spread in order to contain it. 

>the government‚Äôs sudden lockdown has created immense panic and confusion. thousands of migrant workers have been forced to leave their rented homes as they are unable to pay rent. it is important that the government intervenes and provide them money for their rent immediately. factories, small industries and construction sites have closed, tens of thousands of migrant labourers are trying to walk to their villages and are stranded at various state borders. they are rendered totally vulnerable without their daily wages or access to nutrition and basic services. they are struggling to seek refuge as they march to reach far-away homes. it is important that we help them find shelter and inject money directly into their bank accounts to help them survive these arduous next few months. 

>it is also critical that we set up a defensive wall around our key financial and strategic institutions to protect them from the shock wave that is bound to come as the true impact of the virus and our economic shutdown hits us a few weeks from now. our informal economy and immense network of small and medium businesses and farmers are going to be vital to any rebuilding effort. it is crucial that we engage them in a conversation, build their confidence and protect their interests with correct and timely action. 

>we stand together with the government in fighting and overcoming this tremendous challenge. 

>with best wishes, rahul gandhi

now there are attacks on muslims in the name of cow protection but those are just isolated incidents. jayant sinha, one of the suave us educated faces garlands them but, after all, they haven't been convicted.

then comes demonetization but it didn't affect you. so what if it dropped the gdp by 2 points; they meant well, it has laid the foundation for our prosperity. gst came along and, sure a few (many) people complained because it was tough for small business, but it is a great idea and it would be churlish to point out that implementation is part of a government's responsibility.

then came the ed/cbi raids but clearly those raided were guilty and it is just a coincidence that only opponents were targeted. the ec makes decisions that somehow always favor the bjp but we are used to that. important statistics are hidden but we don't trust statistics anyway and amitabh kant tells us that everything is fine.

now come the elections and you vote for the bjp again because rahul. doesn't matter that sadhvi, tejasvi and ananthkumar hegde are standing. doesn't matter that the bigotry extends up to the top, it's an election and the goal is to win the election.

we pass over 370 because why should we care what the kashmiris think? they will be better off in the long run even if we have to turn the state into a prison for a year. and the students should be focusing on their studies. admittedly, they were in the library when the police stormed in but students have to understand that we are paying for their education.

now comes caa but it doesn't apply to citizens and even if it mentions every religion except islam, it is a positive measure because we should welcome refugees. even though amit shah laid out the timeline, nrc has not yet been notified and so why should we worry about something that has not been notified yet. let caa go and then we'll make sure that no citizen is affected. it's not clear yet how we identify citizens (or perhaps it is clear) but we will make sure that no citizen is affected. after all, modi and shah have assured us that no one has to be worried.

now come the riots in delhi but there was clearly violence on both sides. alright more muslim businesses and homes were burnt but they have to learn that we voted this government in and they can't hold up a parliamentary democracy by protesting, even if they are peaceful.

so my question is: is there any point at which you look in the mirror and say enough is enough?

but people are donating for only one group and the campaign is being run by the violent terrorist who should be in jail. he is the scumbag who unleashed the mobs and now he has become the superstar. 

people are just lying and creating 100% fake news about how muslim victim groups are getting money from ""khan market"" or whatever nonsense and so they will not give a single rupee to the muslim victims of kapil mishra's sanghi death squads. 

for example here. these two justifications for this are popular but based on complete lies. of course hindu nationalists have no problem with lies. 

>while muslim victims are being paid from govt. treasure through waqf board, there is nothing for hindus. great job kapil bhai.

>salute sir is working for those poor souls who lost everything in #delhiriots & won‚Äôt get anything from #khanmarket funding

https://twitter.com/saurabh_intc/status/1240102981585883136?s=20




this is so enraging. the worst thing is complete lies they are making up that the muslim victims don't need help because they will be taken of by the ""secular"" or whatever when this is not happening at all. and the man who started the riots directly has faced no consequences and is being treated as a savour. 

imagine in america if someone was to crowdfund for ""white victims only"" in a riot where mostly black people died. 

the right wing in india is so much more openly monstrous and blood thirsty.

but as you'd have guessed by now, he was a modi supporter with strong distrust towards muslims. although he claimed he is not against them (proof that he has so many close muslim friends) but he felt they are extremely fanatic (kattar). i kept asking have they ever forced you or anyone to do anything against their wish. if not how can they be fanatic. whatever their problems it is within their community. he strongly believes muslims have 'enjoyed' the appeasement politics for many years and got so many benefits. how they want to have 4-5 kids to increase their population. he felt all muslims should have gone to pakistan during partition. you know, the usual stuff.

if this is how someone who has close muslim friends thinks, then what can we say about the majority who have very little connection with muslims. every day, every conversation just goes onto solidify my belief that it is impossible to overcome this hate. we will either go the germany way or the israel way. either way the future is not looking good.

this divide will only further deepen if we allow the endless flow of misinformation and fake news through whatsapp and other social media sites.

with the coronavirus further slowing down an already relatively slow economy and increasing an already high unemployment rate, such misinformation will definitely cause more riots (or worse, a civil war).

the ones who will be affected the most by this are the poor. during the delhi riots, most of the people who died and suffered were either poor or of the lower middle class and the ones who are suffering now due to the virus are also the poor. they will only further suffer if such misinformation that causes communal tensions are spread.

to the people who have read this post till now, if you see anybody in whatsapp or any other social media site posting any misinformation or fake news, i implore you to call them out for spreading such misinformation and tell them that it is illegal and punishable if they further do so. whether you are respectful to them or not is at your own discretion. if they still don't stop then report them to the concerned authority.

in a time where medical professionals are being attacked by patients & their kin, where medical professionals are quite vocally expressing their need for ppes, where people are clearly still flouting outside, the leader called this a successful operation & that the next step is to light a candle?

in a time where we see cases of migrants who passed away while walking hundreds of kilometers home, where in a city like mumbai, there is still no proper arrangement to deliver essentials to residents, the leader wants us to stand tall at 9 pm.

and shortly after the speech, the it cell went into overdrive & within a few minutes we recieved whatsapp forwards stating how this 9 pm candle light will rid india of covid-19. and there is no effort or modicum of effort from the authorities to dispel these fake forwards.

i am genuinely scared that people will take this as an opportunity to come out & do bonfires/candlelight marches, and what not.

credit where it is due, the lockdown was needed. but, so was the planning. in a time where the world's eyes are upon india and bloomberg put out an article that shows that india failed it's citizens, the world scrutiny is even more.

should the leader have addressed points like:

- increasing testing (especially in areas like the dharavi slums of mumbai that can become a cluster in no time)?

- ppes for medical professionals?

- urging people to keep medical professionals in regard & to respect them?

- held a call with top virologists & doctors instead of top 40 cricketers?

the who envoy might praise india & i seriously doubt if who's words hold any weight after their disastrous handling of the situation, but i can feel that the world is judging us and laughing at us.

if you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .

the real thing now is ‚Äì why we need to invest. it‚Äôs because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . it always fall and it will be same. that‚Äôs called inflation.

so, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.

so, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.

we will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:

1.¬†share market¬†‚Äì
i just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .

just search in google : reliance share price

at that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. market cap as you see in  is 8.58trillion . so, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .you will know total how many shares are there. share means a part of company. so, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. so, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.

company list these share in nse/bse (national stock exchange/bombay stock exchange) .they offer it to people at a lesser price first known as ipo (initial public offering) . so, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.

the broker is register with nse/bse and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. you can buy ipo or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. you can open demat account with broker. and trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.

for example zerodha, they are india‚Äôs largest share broker -




they are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. 



2. mutual fund :
mutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. so, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.

they are of different types:

i. equity mutual fund:

equity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.
there are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. for example top 50 shares index is called as nifty 50.
a index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.

if someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that‚Äôs called expense ratio. so, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

ii. debt fund:
debt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in government bonds , and company schemes, fd. so, this can be the safest.

iii. there are hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.

for a suggestion, there are rating agency, like morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.

there are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. once you open account there, you use their¬†coin.zerodha.com¬†to trade mutual funds. it‚Äôs free and direct.
you can sign up and use the app to buy. it‚Äôs easy.

you may have heard about terms like lumpsum and sip. lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. sip means investing it on montly basis. so, what sip does is ,it averages out your investment . it means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by sip ,so now your buy price is the average of both.



3.¬†insurance¬†:
insurance means transfer of risk to other . so,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.accordingly it is classified into two types:

i. general insurance
general insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. it is also of different types like

first party ‚Äì first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid

third party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid
these are compulsory in india.

ii. life insurance

life insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.

a. health insurance:
health insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. so if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense

b. term insurance:
term insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . so, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that‚Ä¶

but only death benefit, else you won‚Äôt get money.

c. endowment plans:

if you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.

or if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . endowment for an example is like this.

you get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.

basically, i believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges . health insurance is a must though.",vikashred,saying nifty index sensex index funds tracks index index funds,979,7,4.4495145631067965,6.571428571428571,finance basics share market mutual fund insurance lets learn something home doubts message me earning know put money put money real thing need invest value everything buy food clothes land everything rising thing falling is value money always fall same that called inflation so keeping money declining around 6 percent every year so invest investment products if see past years rising anything fixed deposit gold mutual fund share market discuss share market mutual fund insurance below 1 share market google search company called reliance showed share price search google reliance share price time search showed 1353 per share value market cap see 8 58trillion so divide mkt cap value per share you know total many shares there share means part company so company might keep 51 share giving rest public buy means selling ownership company part money so use money may clear debt expand company list share nse bse national stock exchange bombay stock exchange they offer lesser price first known ipo initial public offering so subscribe broker allotment done broker register nse bse open account broker buy sell share buy ipo buy already listed share exchange allow sell buy share among individual shares hold demat account demat account basically deposit account share bank account money open demat account broker trading simple buy button buy sell button sell example zerodha largest share broker discount brokers means charge less trading least mutual fund mutual fund giving someone money rights manage funds so different varities funds chose fund manager would give money to different types equity mutual fund equity mutual fund buy shares different types investing small cap shares large mix both index funds too index means instrument sums share market growth decline example top 50 shares index called nifty 50 index fund track nifty 50 requirement fund managers someone managing fund much harder effort charge money that that called expense ratio so nifty fund expense ratio lowest ii debt fund debt fund doesnot directly invest shares invest government bonds company schemes fd so safest iii hybrid funds means mix funds suggestion rating agency morning star invest 5 star rated funds various direct mutual fund apps available charge less expense ratio link provided zerodha share market section open account there use coin zerodha trade mutual funds free direct sign use app buy easy may heard terms lumpsum sip lumpsum basically investing amount once sip means investing montly basis so sip averages investment means april bought high price may market fell still bought sip so buy price average both 3 insurance insurance means transfer risk so there companies transfer risk vehicle health life basically financially accordingly classified two types general insurance general insurance relates bike cars etc different types first party first party means insured person accident will paid third party means accident paid compulsory ii life insurance life insurance health insurance term insurance endowment plans etc health insurance health insurance means covers hospital expenses got disease bill amount lakhs rupees could drain investment right health insurance the company covers expense b term insurance term insurance means earning member family after die support so giving premium 6000 per year after die family lumpsum 60 lakh that death benefit else won t money c endowment plans giving 50000 premium 5 years getting 5 lakh 10 years depends market die nominee gets 5 lakh endowment example this maturity benefit death benefit too premiums high basically believe dont need endowment better invest mutual fund take term insurance since endowment huge charges health insurance must though

the virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. the situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. this is a trust issue in the markets and economics. there is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

we will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. the stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. if trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. you haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. for a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. that's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

if a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. on the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. this time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a china propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

it's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. there is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in india tracing far back as 2016. it's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. the investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. i hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",abbawaddadu,pray gets,520,13,4.74236641221374,4.384615384615385,would gone recession regardless virus part rant seem forget already major financial issues really highlighting bad rollout demonetization ilfs issue leading npa issue slow growth real estate industry certain metropolitan areas consolidation banks issues yes bank impending nbfc crisis top air bad performance bunch real issues happened past 5 years internationally trade war brexit currently oil war saudi arabia russia virus something would wrecked economy something multiplying impact already existing issues situation right similar 2008 situation fundamental shift thought right trust issue markets economics mistrust stakeholders commerce virus eventually markets recover stock markets drama queens sensitive everything trumps stupid words could trigger downward trend imagine would happened shit actually hit fan remember loss wealth imaginary sort based perceptions actually lost money long book losses person invested 5 6 years back stock lost opportunity profit nothing ever promised that instruments come terms conditions share falls 30 mean company really good fundamentals performance track lose 30 intrinsic value minutes hand company extremely leveraged pre existing skeletons closet going horrible them time period companies opening honest positions less china propoganda lockdown bad thing sad see lose jobs matter weather 1 million lose jobs every year 6 mill freak event going happen eventually fundamental demand side shock happened tracing far back 2016 ironic enemies black money hoarders economy informal sector vegetable vendors kirana shops local chai walla currently world managing actually saving local district microeconomic commerce supply chains flexibility right world icu paying massive hospital bill disease lack investment essentials infrastructure healthcare education investment directed towards fancier things seemed cool matter izzat time hope done forget local kirana shops supply chain guys managed keep things running
Business/Finance,psa: don't opt for the 3-month moratorium unless you absolutely have to and definitely don't do it for your credit cards,124,ftybqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftybqp/psa_dont_opt_for_the_3month_moratorium_unless_you/,23,2020-04-03 14:16:16,"i see a lot of misinformation floating around about the rbi moratorium and though quite a few news outlets have picked up the topic since yesterday, i guess it is easy for news to slip through in this surreal climate right now. what prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money 'saved' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  
     
when you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan emis what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly emi for the period still left on the loan. so, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly emi is ‚Çπ20000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than ‚Çπ60000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about ‚Çπ1l and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). this might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to covid but definitely not otherwise.      

credit cards are a whole other story. their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was ‚Çπ1l, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you'd owe about ‚Çπ1,10,400. moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in june when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. even if you're under extreme financial duress and absolutely can't make your card payments, i'd wager that you'll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.",ChelshireGoose,confirm available credit cards well dont need apply moratorium loans may simply choose pay,369,21,4.639664804469274,4.761904761904762,psa opt 3 month moratorium unless absolutely definitely credit cards see lot misinformation floating around rbi moratorium though quite news outlets picked topic since yesterday guess easy news slip surreal climate right now prompted make post friend asked suggestions invest money saved due moratorium credit card payments next three months which completely bonkers idea avail moratorium regular house auto personal gold loan emis essentially equivalent taking loan top up amount monthly emi period still left loan so still 10 years loan monthly emi 20000 deferring 3 months payment essentially taken loan little 60000 additional payment burden whatever interest compounded monthly accumulated amount whole 10 years assuming interest rate 10 additional payment burden comes 1l tenure extension 8 months over 3 months deferred might make sense lost job going extreme financial dishevelment due covid definitely otherwise credit cards whole story interest rates crazy about 40 per annum means credit card bill month 1l 3 month moratorium period compounded interest still accumulating owe 1 10 400 moreover amount stare back full june likely financial situation may much better now given facts makes sense avail moratorium benefits credit card dues somehow able manage money even extreme financial duress absolutely can t make card payments d wager still able better credit card interest rate

***lock ‚Äì on means 'disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

we never would‚Äôve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world‚Äôs population would be in a lockdown. while the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. the lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today‚Äôs situation. make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. if you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

this pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** how prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. talking about investments, the fds, stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. the alternate investment options like sips, mutual funds too aren‚Äôt performing. 

remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is home**. a sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. it is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

a critical question arising out of the covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and real estate post the lockdown?**

studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. however, as said by benjamin franklin, ‚Äúout of adversity comes opportunity‚Äù. the sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to invest in real estate, against all the current odds. 

real estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**why will the indian real estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. the world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of india and china, according to a latest un trade report.

2. the virus pushes u.s.-chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent u.s.-chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. this rift will lead india to gain interests of global investors and companies. these investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. these factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in india.

3. china lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of covid 19 to the world. after china, india is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. india so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. indian real estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a nation full of values and ethics, leading india with great avenues to become a global superpower.

5. nri investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst rupee fall.

while the above conditions make india a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **emotional investment**: in india, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. the sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. interestingly, after our first name, ‚Äòhome‚Äô is second most used word in the world every day. ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the world will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**statistics:** the indian real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be usd 650 bn by 2025 and usd 1,000 bn by 2030. residential, commercial and retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector‚Äôs growth. real estate contributed nearly 6% to india‚Äôs gdp in 2017. as per the projected growth trends, the sector‚Äôs contribution is likely to rise to 13% of india‚Äôs gdp by 2025.

¬∑ **real estate ‚Äì largest employment generator:** after agriculture, real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **india‚Äôs real estate employee base is estimated to be 67 mn by 2022.**

¬∑ **high tangible asset value:** real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

¬∑ **competitive risk- adjustment returns :** based on july 2018 data from national council of real estate investment fiduciaries **(ncreif),** private market **commercial real estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** this credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

¬∑ **attractive and stable income return (specially in commercial space):** the **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. commercial investment can yield upto 12% roi and lowest to 5% roi (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

¬∑ **inflation hedging:** the inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between gdp growth and demand for real estate. as economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

¬∑ **long term ‚Äúassured‚Äù wealth building asset with ‚Äúpredictable ‚Äú returns and least risk** :- real estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of regular **‚Äúpredictable‚Äù returns (yield is higher than dividend returns) and an ‚Äúassured‚Äù capital appreciation in long term**, don‚Äôt be scared of corporate scams, while they can affect the company‚Äôs stock price or your bank‚Äôs health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

¬∑ **‚Äúhelps you raise money quickly‚Äù** \- **hard asset is the most preferred collateral for a bank**, to raise capital through a loan (lap/lrd) your property is the best asset you could own!

¬∑ **the ever rising fsi benefit** \- **‚Äúwine and real estate improve with age‚Äù** \- while as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing fsi norms of mmr the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of real estate in central mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

¬∑ **work from home culture:** we are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. we expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. so commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

¬∑ **student housing:** an unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in india. real estate consultancy firm, anarock property consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in india, more than 75% live away from home. existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. developers in mumbai & pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

¬∑ **co-living market** size across india‚Äôs top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. the demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a cushman & wakefield india report.

¬∑ **reits are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. unlike other equity investments, reits provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. reits are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. there is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. india's first listed reit, has gained 50% since listing in march 2019 as against a 10% gain in the nifty realty index and 5% return of the benchmark nifty 50.

¬∑ india‚Äôs improved rank on **ease of doing business** and the courage to implement reforms such as demo, rera, and ibc are indeed creditworthy. these are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**why real estate during lockdown?**

probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. here is why ‚Äì**

1. **reduction in home loan rates:** on 27 march 2020, the reserve bank of india (rbi) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). the reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. new home loan rates start at 8% from 1 march 2020. so indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **low demand ‚Äì value for money:** real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by developers. to maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. end-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **reduction in stamp duty:** the maharashtra government on march 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for mumbai, mmrda region and pune for a period of two years.

4. **passive income:** various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. this is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **demand- supply breakthrough:** due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. but once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. the rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **segment shift** : earlier lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 lakh property. now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **strike the iron when it is hot:** we all must have heard this at least once. but it‚Äôs time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some developers is as high as 15-18%.

**final thoughts:** 

**your money is safe in indian real estate**

\- regulator like maharera leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- high court judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- nclt giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- the supreme court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**the bottom line**

**real estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , it is about the safest investment in the world.**

real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor‚Äôs portfolio. on its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. real estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual‚Äôs cash flow and wealth.

**‚Äúbuy real estate in areas where the path exists , and buy more real estate where there is no path, but you can create your own. don‚Äôt wait to buy real estate , buy real estate and wait.**

i am a bit confused on some of the allowances in the offer breakdown - i have been offered a base salary and along with that i get house rent allowance, special allowance, vehicle reimbursement and internet allowance.

1. for house allowance - do i have to submit the rental agreement to the employer to claim it? or do i have to submit it to someone else i.e. when filing taxes end of year? does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord?
2. do i have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary?
3. how do i claim the vehicle and internet allowance - is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly?

basically trying to understand how much i can expect to get as a salary deposit in my account

Business/Finance,a dialogue for indians to understand why bitcoin even exists,13,fo4779,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fo4779/a_dialogue_for_indians_to_understand_why_bitcoin/,9,2020-03-25 01:50:37,"**tl;dr owner of a bank or financial institute can change the amount of money in the financial system (modern money is just a number in the banks database), while manipulation of this nature is impossible on block chain**

**given the current indian financial market situation me and a friend had this dialogue to try and understand if bitcoin is of any use to us.. may be it helps you start a conversation with someone else and get a better understanding of things.**  

i‚Äôm a stock market trader and recently i was talking to this friend of mine who is into bitcoin as  well as the stock market.. 

he asked me if i knew why bitcoin was needed in this world.. 

and my answer was.. an alternate currency

turns out it‚Äôs got an actual reason for existing

**btc is an alternative to fiat currency? or ‚Äústore of value‚Äù like how gold is?**

but bitcoin is not like gold at all. 

* gold is valuable as a metal. 
* it is soft, malleable, 
* very good conductor of electricity, 
* safe to the skin unlike copper and does not tarnish over time. 
* if we needed gold in large quantities and cost wasn‚Äôt a problem, we can actually create gold in particle accelerators. so it's not a matter of gold being scarce

**bitcoin has no physical value like gold. bitcoin is all digital.**

&#x200b;

**a simple though experiment:**

let‚Äôs assume i open a bank called dvz bank and people have deposited a total of rs.1,000 with my bank. 

* now people and corporations come to me asking for loans and i give them a combined loan of rs. 10,000. 

where did the extra rs.9,000 come from? 

you decide whether this is a problem or not for a financial system.

**as it turns out, in the modern world, money is just a number in a bank's software. it can be tweaked any way the controlling authorities want.**

as an authority, without a few people in my pocket, i  could set up a xyz business just for the purpose of creating money. xyz business would never make a single rupee in profit but we will keep adding new money into the xyzs bank account every month. it's our bank. our software. our database. who is to stop us? 

whereas blockchain is a self-regulating database. 

**once an entry is made into the blockchain, it can not be edited without destroying the whole database. it maintains integrity by nature.** 

**so, if 21 million bitcoins are coded into the database, it cannot ever become 22 million bitcoins. whereas in any other currency or banking platform it can be changed.** 

banks are based on ledgers that can be manipulated by the bank owners and governing parties. 

bitcoin runs on blockchain ledgers which are immutable.

to break this down ever further, let‚Äôs say you have 100 rupees in paytm wallet and paytm‚Äôs core developer is your best friend. you can convince him to turn that 100 into 10,000. this cannot be done with bitcoin, if that is done, the whole database breaks.

has this ever happened? paytm has been accused of internal fraud by audit companies multiple times. a famous incident that can be quickly searched online is where an ex paytm employee created fake transactions in order to earn from cashbacks. total fraud of over 10cr. 

the loans given out in bitcoins will be real bitcoins and not fake money which eventually turns into real money. banks give out money that they don‚Äôt have and don't recover, that leaves a hole in the financial system.

blockchain is attempting to provide a very clean and efficient financial system, to have a record of what‚Äôs coming in and what‚Äôs going out. if implemented successfully, we will do away with printing money and bringing in helicopter money during times like these. it will all be a zero-sum game then.

your thoughts in comments please (we are figuring this out through a dialogue so please be constructive with the comments, in a way that we learn a thing a two from your comments too)

**negatives of block chain/bitcoin** 

we came across some negatives for bitcoin too.

if country has trillion $ economy.. and it gets burned..by some natural calamity or some other factor

no problem, govt will pump in another trillion into existence and live on.

but if i have million bitcoins and lose the key

but this hit us in a very unexpected way. malls which were crowded all the times, are shut. public transport are running almost empty. 
everything is so silent outside that you can feel the air is clean. you can actually hear the birds singing. if you pay attention, in cities you can see more stars at night these days. well, nature has its own way to clear the dirt. 

but we are humans, lets just be mean and think from our perspective. within a week, the offices are empty. small businesses gave their employees work from home. big companies are following 50% occupancy rule.

for some time i want you guys to think emotionally and be logical. the scene is bigger than the virus. 

**we are not heading for a recession, we are heading towards depression.**

it companies who were working on projects which are almost 80% complete. just have those projects in their hand. which will pay them not more than 25% of the final amount of the proposal.

projects which were about to start, have shut, projects which were between 35-70% completion, are paused. and there are no new projects.

constructions and real estate sectors in cities have stopped for next 6 months. big companies, have circulated the mail to small vendors that there won't be any money coming for atleast next 6 months. (cement, steel, rocks and bricks provider, architects, etc etc) who work on a month or 3 month money rotation, and mind you, even the smallest vendor work for not less than 10 lacks rotation, got no money. these guys are in immediate debts. 

manufacturing is yet to hit, coz people are still buying stuff. but this will stop in a month. 

coming back to, people dont have projects to work and money to rotate. they (we) are having funds to sustain our staff for 6 months. but, this works when the world is fine and we don't have projects.
the case is different here. the world is burning and we can see that businesses are not going to get any thing for next 1 year minimum. so this is not the time to think about employees, but to save the company and the investment. 
employee class is going to get the salary of april. that's it. that's the fact.

learn it, love it, live it. byheart it. write it on a paper and stick to the wall, get up and read this everyday. prepare yourself. 

do not enjoy this time as you are working from home. use this time to think. plan your actions, cut your expenses. if you have savings for 6 months, make sure you use it for a year.

unfortunately, this catastrophe is an opportunity for big companies to layoff thousands of their non-performing employees (npe). the number will be as big as 60%.
and for small businesses, 80% (small businesses usually dont have npe, every employee is an asset but its directly proportional to the company's turnover and number of projects).

so lets just take a rough number that almost around 40% - 50% people are loosing their jobs in june-july.

but people who earn daily wages, have started feeling the impact right now. 

constructions would stop, killing the daily wages of construction workers. spending capacity will reduce, killing semi luxury utilities like cab/auto, restaurants , travel. 

do not expect any compensation from government, and for country's good, please dont! 

country needs money to run. hospitals, food, maintaining law and order, may be camps, these will suck a lot of money from govt locker.
so don't expect any lone wavers, tax exemptions, bill exemptions or reducing petrol price coz its down world wide.
yes we can argue that the banks gave loan to some individuals and they ran away and potato potato. what's gone is gone. 
if the government works in our favour, its good. but dont keep any hope.

this week took businesses atleast 6 months back. and in coming days, we are going to loose almost 2-3 years of hardwork and buildup. 

days are going to be hard. this is not the post to scare people. i dont care about the upvotes or downvotes. 

i feel bad when i see people enjoying work from home. i saw people who were asked by companies 'office will be shut, you cant take your systems home, if you have laptops, we will install the required softwares to your system and you can continue working'
and people straight away said 'no' to that.
for your information, business remembers everything, thats how business evolves. and business is an entity without heart. 
you guys are the first one the companies gonna layoff. 

last but not the least, while i was planning, i jotted down a lot of points but while writing, i'm sure i missed a lot. please feel free to ask any questions you have. 
please feel free to suggest any actions which can be implemented which will help both the business and employees.",sardikhasi,saving plans since ve recently joined new job guess ll first decide layoff,839,6,4.623391812865497,6.166666666666667,covid 19 business impacts recession covid 19 global catastrophe right now something took lightly initial stage country individuals business hit us unexpected way malls crowded times shut public transport running almost empty everything silent outside feel air clean actually hear birds singing pay attention cities see stars night days well nature way clear dirt humans lets mean think perspective within week offices empty small businesses gave employees work home big companies following 50 occupancy rule time want guys think emotionally logical scene bigger virus we heading recession heading towards depression companies working projects almost 80 complete projects hand pay 25 final amount proposal projects start shut projects 35 70 completion paused new projects constructions real estate sectors cities stopped next 6 months big companies circulated mail small vendors money coming atleast next 6 months cement steel rocks bricks provider architects etc etc work month 3 month money rotation mind you even smallest vendor work less 10 lacks rotation got money guys immediate debts manufacturing yet hit coz still buying stuff stop month coming back to dont projects work money rotate we funds sustain staff 6 months but works world fine projects case different here world burning see businesses going thing next 1 year minimum time think employees save company investment employee class going salary april that that fact learn love live byheart write paper stick wall read everyday prepare yourself enjoy time working home use time think plan actions cut expenses savings 6 months make sure use year unfortunately catastrophe opportunity big companies layoff thousands non performing employees npe number big 60 small businesses 80 small businesses usually dont npe every employee asset directly proportional company turnover number projects lets take rough number almost around 40 50 loosing jobs june july earn daily wages started feeling impact right now constructions would stop killing daily wages construction workers spending capacity reduce killing semi luxury utilities cab auto restaurants travel expect compensation government country good please dont country needs money run hospitals food maintaining law order may camps suck lot money govt locker expect lone wavers tax exemptions bill exemptions reducing petrol price coz world wide yes argue banks gave loan individuals ran away potato potato what gone gone government works favour good dont keep hope week took businesses atleast 6 months back coming days going loose almost 3 years hardwork buildup days going hard post scare dont care upvotes downvotes feel bad see enjoying work home saw asked companies office shut cant take systems home laptops install required softwares system continue working straight away said no that information business remembers everything thats business evolves business entity without heart guys first companies gonna layoff last least planning jotted lot points writing sure missed lot please feel free ask questions have please feel free suggest actions implemented help business employees

okay, now here's the story, my dad passed away last november and since then it has been a problem to maintain our bills, and it certainly doesn't help that we are under a big home loan, which my dad and mom took couple of years ago, and wasn't able to pay because my father lost his job then, he did try to get a job now and then... and he manage to earn some money to help with the loan, and mine and my sisters study.. my mom also used to work 2 shifts (9-10 hours) 2 different jobs... 

but now the situation after my dad passed away is..

- i m a student grade 12,
- and my mom only works one job in the morning, because she isn't comfortable anymore..

- my mom's salary is less than the amount we should be paying for the loan per month

- he didn't have any life insurance
- the money my mom earns, goes into helping with bills, maintainance, etc. my school fees

- i do have my grandparents with ample amount of money to help us, but for what ever reason they aren't helping right now, it could be the fact if he helps with such an high amount, the members in the family might expect him to divide his wealth next, and i personally don't want that kind of strain in our family.. so we aren't pushing that idea home..

-and the problem is not the home loan, but the other loan we took from different banks to pay are existing loans, (bad decision, i know)

anyways what i want to know is, that if their is any way we could be helped in this situation, with any law or a program launched by government of some sorts, i just need financial advice on what should be the next step, so their is not a lot of burden on my mom... 

i will be glad to have any helpüôèüòî

this is post is just to warn small retail traders who blindly follow big traders and try to copy them. the experienced and seasoned traders have their risks calculated behind every trade they enter into and even if the trade goes wrong they have firefighting skills in order to exit at breakeven or with minimum losses.

i would say that instead of blindly following others spend time in enhancing your trading skills and observe live charts daily to sense the market moves on your own. when you know the reason behind a trade entry then you will be more confident about it instead of taking a trade posted by someone else.

i am also a retail trader just like everyone else out there. but i trade based on my analysis and to give you yesterday's example my analysis was saying there will be correction at the market opening and thus exactly at 9.17 am i posted below tweet from my twitter account.

Business/Finance,is this a good deal?,6,fxpcir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxpcir/is_this_a_good_deal/,3,2020-04-09 22:53:03,"hey guys.
hope you're staying safe in these troubled times. 
it's probably not the right time to ask questions like the one i'm going to ask now but i really need your help. 
so here's the scene. 

i've just finished my undergrad degree and have been approached by a startup to be a co-founder. basically, it's a startup in the legaltech industry and they want someone with both legal and tech experience to take the company forward. 

it's two years old and is incubated by one of the leading law firms in the country. this firm is mentoring and guiding the team and the team is looking to raise its first funding round come september. 

upon speaking to the founder, i found him to be quite passionate and hardworking. we have been on call a few times since then, and we have exchanged business ideas and strategies about the marketplace and the future of the startup. 

here's a rough idea of the deal i'm getting offered. 
he's offering me an equity stake in the company. (the valuation or the percent stake is not crystallized yet but is negotiable). 
my rent and meals will also be taken care of. transport cost is negligible as the place is situated close to the incubator. 
in addition, i've asked him that i would like to draw a salary as well for my miscellaneous personal expenditure (sutta, daaru etc) 
this startup is based out of delhi. 

what i want to know is this a good deal? i've spoken to a few people in the startup scene and have gotten mixed reviews although the majority want me to go ahead and take this gig. 

i do want to join this startup. it offers me responsibility, and i'm reading and learning about my job everyday and its super fun. 

what i'm confused about is the deal that i'll strike with them. how much equity stake should i ask for? how much salary should i ask? ( they're bootstrapped and living off of cash prizes won off several hackathons). 
any other questions which might be pertinent to ask? so that all formalities are taken care off and i can start work at the earliest. 

please help out a brother in need!

1) what are you general thoughts about these platforms?
2) how much are they contributing to society? do you view it as a good, noble initiative or people behind these are putting up a philanthropic front to make money?
3) where are they lacking? what could they do better as they are far behind international players like kickstarter etc
4) what changes would you make to these platforms?
5) what makes you trust/not trust these platforms?
6) have you had a personal experience with them as a donor or as someone raising funds? how was the experience?

now they're refusing to allow me to stay without the dinner and refusing to refund my booking. heartbroken that lalit would stoop so low as to cheat guests with fine print and trickery.

i made the booking cos it's my lil sister's first new years in india and i wanted it to be special! but now instead of the 25k i've saved up it's 58k which there's no way i can afford. i'm literally in tears. this is more than my monthly expenses and i have no idea what to do. they've got me in a choke hold. if i cancel, i lose 25 k and i will have to book another hotel which at such short notice will be exorbitant. the alternative is worse. stay and pay the 33 k which is simply not an option. 

what should i do? i feel so helpless. breaks my heart that this special occasion that we've been looking forward to and saving up for has been ruined by corporate greed üò≠ 

tl;dr: booked room for 25k for two days, got hit with 33k hidden cost for 1 mandatory nye dinner.

edit: thanks for the overwhelming support and excellent advice. thanks to y'all i've started recording all calls and maintaining records of communication with them. 
updates and clarifications:
1. we're two females travelling alone and my sister is a child/minor so i saved up for the lalit for safety reasons as well as wanting to make her first indian new year special
2. i booked through agoda using my debit card. many people have pointed out this should have been done through credit card but i don't have one. 
3. agoda customer service were sympathetic but said lalit have to approve the refund and they're refusing to do so.
4. lalit manager called and let it slip that many other customers are unhappy and in the same boat but lalit policy is that they can't refund. tried to put the blame on agoda but when i said i'd spoken to agoda and they were happy to initiate cancellation, he didn't say much apart from ehm well according to policy we can't do this bla bla. 
4. put the incident on instagram story and tagged both lalit group and keshav suri, one of the more insta savvy and seemingly fair lalit bosses. no response so far.

edit 2:
got a message on insta from lalitgroup who said their manager will call me. waiting for the call and will update once it happens. 

edit 3: 
all sorted! they agreed the messaging was unclear but blamed agoda for the listing. nevertheless after posting on insta, social media team contacted me, the lalit goa got in touch and offered me a discount on the gala dinner of up to 50%. i still couldn't afford 17/18k for a dinner so insisted on a full refund instead which they finally agreed to. agoda were supportive and immediately agreed to process the refund but said it might take up to 30 days to credit the refund back into my bank account. fingers crossed but looks like it's all sorted now.

couple of days ago my sister law got scammed by upi phishing, i heard this type of scam for the first time.

she wanted to send courier through blue-dart, she searched the customer care contact number of bluedart through google.  she called the number appearing on the first search (first mistake).  the guy told her that o collect the courier she needs to forward an sms to a number and to fill a google form sent her through link.  they forwarded her an sms containing alphanumeric next and she forwarded it to the number she was told (second mistake).  then she filled up the google form mentioning her name and upi id (i think she might have also included upi pin) (third mistake).  

at night time around 2 am, series of sms came and around 37k of money got deducted from her three bank accounts.  she didnt have upi linked to her yes bank account, that also they linked and deducted money from that.

from the first mistake, it can be realized that scamsters are using google ads for using their contact numbers to be shown as customer numbers for legit business like bluedart, fedex , swiggy etc.

second mistake : i am not sure why they asked her to forward the weird alphanumeric sms to some number.  as per my understanding you need physical sim card present in your phone for upi app to detect and register your number with your bank account, might be they are using this sms to clone your sim number some how.  i didnt understand the usage of forwarding the sms to a number.

third mistake :  this was a rookie mistake to give your upi id and might be also along with it upi pin to strangers

so guys please beware of this scam , when you search on google about contacts numbers for some business , please make sure don't click on the ads shown by google.  as you have got the contact number from google you think the person on the other side of the phone is genuine which makes things easier for scamster.",salute2vishal,op said upi linked yes bank account,359,6,4.383098591549296,4.333333333333333,beware guys upi phishing scam hi guys couple days ago sister law got scammed upi phishing heard type scam first time wanted send courier blue dart searched customer care contact number bluedart google called number appearing first search first mistake guy told collect courier needs forward sms number fill google form sent link forwarded sms containing alphanumeric next forwarded number told second mistake filled google form mentioning name upi id think might included upi pin third mistake night time around am series sms came around 37k money got deducted three bank accounts didnt upi linked yes bank account linked deducted money that first mistake realized scamsters using google ads using contact numbers shown customer numbers legit business bluedart fedex swiggy etc second mistake sure asked forward weird alphanumeric sms number per understanding need physical sim card present phone upi app detect register number bank account might using sms clone sim number how didnt understand usage forwarding sms number third mistake rookie mistake give upi id might along upi pin strangers guys please beware scam search google contacts numbers business please make sure click ads shown google got contact number google think person side phone genuine makes things easier scamster

as per the article in [businesstoday.in](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-impact-50-restaurants-to-shutdown-if-lockdown-extends-till-may/story/399903.html) which is regarding the restaurant survival during the lock-down period in india it is said that:

**50% restaurants to shut if lockdown extends; zomato, swiggy business down 10% :** only 5-6 restaurant chains have enough cash reserves to sustain more than a month, the sector will need government's help if there's no improvement after may.

well, their is always a brighter side of the story! and this lockdown period can well utilized for all the research and development for the new market. yes! you read it correct, it is going to be a fresh and new market, for you and your current restaurant too. so what does a new comer in the market does? what pre-launch preparation he does ? what he wants to boast about before and after the launch?¬†

lemme tell you if you want to survive in this new market once this covid-19 lockdown in india is over, you have to work upon one and only one thing and it is your re-branding & marketing! yes, people must not forget your name from the market! and people must know what you are going to offer after the market is open. obviously you are going to bank upon takeaway orders initially for few weeks or can be a month or two! now when you know about this right now, then you can always cut short your staffing according to the needs of a take-away joint. service guys can be asked to work on stipends for a month or can be motivated for the salary in coming month in part payments. good ones will stay with you! don't worry.¬†

do not worry about staffing for next few months at-least, because their will be plenty of manpower available, filtered out from those restaurants who did not survived the impact. a great possibility of salary negotiation too.¬†

work upon the zero waste menu. do some research, zero waste menu is something where the only food waste is the stuff which once cannot digest or is toxic/not recommended to eat. for planned zero waste menu you may contact here and you might get some professional help if needed.¬†

get a nice air purifier and alkaline water purifier if possible. why? well apart from the health benefits, this thing is going to help you a lot in your re-launch event, how? we gonna talk in points mentioned below in a while. their are hotel grades version for kitchen and guest area as cheap as 40k .¬†

try to arrange your in-house delivery guy, so that you can save upon the commissions from swiggy & zomato, as their will be good number of delivery orders, saving upon the commission can save you your one month electricity bill for sure! will tell you the ways to promote your own contact .

now: all is set you have done all of the above mentioned points, asked your landlord to waive off your rent and luckily he agreed! :)¬†

its 10 days left now before lockdown gets over, what next?¬†

boost your internet / instagram / youtube / facebook with all the energy you got!¬†

now its time to hit hard with a well planned hospitality grade digital marketing campaign which is going to make your customers and as well as the potentially new customers about the things you have got for them once the market is open.

its time to showcase your new zero waste menu with cool offers, you are going to shout about the healthy environment your outlet is going to offer to your staff as well as the people who walk in, you are going to boast about the alkaline way of cooking meals, you are going to boast about all the reasons you have for your existing customers as well as new customers to visit.¬†

a well planned digital media campaign tailored for hotel and restaurant needs is an only way which can help you get out of this mess and help you survive the crash. ¬†

when hiring any digital media expert, ask them about their knowledge in the field of hotel/restaurant or f&b sector. why? because if they know the 01s of f&b industry then they will be able to target your clients, menu promotions, promotions of your other food services easily. you just need to tell them what you want. rest you can leave all upon them, the deals, promo etc too, remember the points mentioned above, and don't worry! situation is all fine, what is required ? a bit of creativity and vision.¬†

amazon, alongwith the other tech giants google, facebook, microsoft have mastered the art of tax avoidance and shifting profits offshore.

amazon itself has destroyed book stores, mom & pop stores and other small businesses in the us. only mega corporations like walmart, target etc can compete with them in the offline sphere.

they have a history of shitty labor practices. employees being forced to pee in bottles in order to meet quotas, delivery drivers being overworked to death.

and on top of that, amazon looks for special privileges and tax incentives when deciding for new headquarters, offices & fulfillment centers. they know they have a monopoly in the online marketplace and abuse that fact to strong arm local goverments to give them special tax incentives, resulting in loss of state & federal taxes.

i'm sure there are other factors too (plastic waste, shady sellers and fake products etc) which someone more knowledgeable than me can hopefully explain better

Policy/Economy,"delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ‚Çπ17,000 crore allocated to states. here's why",389,fv9ifd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/,64,2020-04-05 20:19:55,"hi there!

as is being reported by the news, approximately ‚Çπ17,000 crore has been allocated by the centre to the states. here is a representative news report: [""centre grants rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", times of india](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

of this ‚Çπ17,000 crore, ‚Çπ11,092 crore is the union's contribution to the ""state disaster response mitigation funds (sdrmfs)"" and the rest is as a ""revenue deficit grant"".

**tl;dr:** the short answer on why delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the fifteenth finance commission (xv-fc) has not included delhi in its recommendations. this is because delhi is not a state. the finance commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the union government and state governments.

**deep dive:**

the xv-fc recommended creation of a new ‚Äúdisaster mitigation and response fund‚Äù üí∞ at union (ndrmf) and state levels (sdrmfs).

these new funds are distinct from the o.g. üòé 'national disaster response fund' (ndrf) and sdrfs under the disaster management act, 2005. the ndrf and srdfs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*‚Äù

the ndrmf and sdrmf are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the union and state governments.

*note 1*: the difference here lies in the words **response** (ndrf/sdrf) and **mitigation** (ndrmf/sdrmf). mitigation is pre-disaster. mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*note 2*: the ndrmf/sdrmf are statutory (legal) funds under the disaster management act, 2005 üìù. just like the ndrf and sdrfs.

*note 3*: the supreme court üë®‚Äç‚öñ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (üôÑ) directed the creation of a national disaster mitigation fund (ndmf) and state sdmfs. this was criticized a lot cause the court‚Äôs got no business in the executive üíº working. this direction was not followed by most governments in india, and has remained a non-starter üö´

similarly, the approximately ‚Çπ6000 crore of revenue-deficit grants are only for state governments.

**edit and update:** it seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. the union‚Äôs devolution under the xv-fc‚Äôs recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the coronavirus epidemic. it also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the government of delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. some possible financing mechanisms that i‚Äôve elaborated in the comments section are:

* further union contributions to delhi‚Äôs sdrf (most effective)
* making funds available from the union home affairs ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* ways and means advances from rbi (30 day credit limit)
* union spending through new delhi municipal corporation (limited geographical spread)
* municipal bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* allocations from pmnrf and pm-cares

my father works in bank and travels with his bike to work. despite no problem other than minor stop and check during first phase of lockdown, he was stopped today and asked for pass and documents but even then police fined him.

he was given 2 options  seizure of hi bike or pay challan. he paid the challan of course but fact remains he had necessary travel pass, a copy of government circular allowing his movement, his bank document.

if this is how so called ""essential workers"" are harassed, how will they do their work. but i shouldn't be surprised though given even doctors have been beaten, evicted and worse.

**tl; dr**

in today‚Äôs speech announcing the extension of india‚Äôs national lockdown till 3rd may, 2020 the country‚Äôs prime minister requested citizens to [**download the** ***aarogya setu*** **application**](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/pm-modi-says-aarogya-setu-app-is-critical-in-the-fight-against-covid-here-is-how-it-works-2576857.html). unfortunately, the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation, strict purpose limitation, transparency and accountability. iff‚Äôs working paper, analyses the application, highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy, is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance, and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks.

**background**

on april 13, 2020 iff released its working paper called, ¬†‚Äú[***privacy prescriptions for technology interventions on covid-19 in india***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uk5relhcdp5t3y-8fyp6ccgqkkpqbeox/view)‚Äù. a significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in india but across the world. india has also launched its own contact tracing solution called *aarogya setu*.

iff‚Äôs working paper was alert to this and chapters 5-7 devote significant space in studying the emergent government and non-government practices, standard setting processes and first principles in the space. chapter 7 of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the singapore government‚Äôs *trace together* application, mit‚Äôs *private kit: safe paths* initiative, and *aarogya setu*.

**what is contact tracing?**

according to the who, contact tracing occurs in three steps namely (a) contact identification; (b) contact listing; and (c) contact follow up. in particular, contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus. this pace of transmission is measured by the unit r0 (r naught) which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto.

contact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies. however, with the ubiquity of smartphones, which collect vast troves of personal information, governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing. but owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus, authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance (both with cell tower data and with gps signals).   


as a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use bluetooth beacons or gps signals to log instances wherein a user‚Äôs device comes in contact with another user‚Äôs device. when a user of the app is detected to have covid-19, contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks.  


**what‚Äôs the risk?**   


with the creation of such systems, come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance. critically, india lacks a comprehensive data protection law, outdated surveillance and interception laws, or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform. in domains like disaster relief, ¬†most apps which are purported as ‚Äòcontact tracing‚Äô technologies, they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement.

a lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest. it leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between ‚Äúsnake oil‚Äù and quality technology products. these risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality.

such systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones. specifically, it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas. in countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits. if such systems wrongly urge people to pre-emptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely.

it may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information, and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems.

**how to prevent these risks?**

such systems must consider embedding the following principles among others:

1. the usage of these applications should be voluntary
2. all data should always be stored locally on people‚Äôs devices
3. this data must be encrypted
4. no government can access it at a later point, so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server
5. governments must appreciate that any data from location information, to proximity confirmations, to health status, to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information.
6. privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded, all data is encrypted, pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù and based on consent. most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention.  


therefore, we need to adhere to two principles:

1. strict limits ¬†(in terms of collection and duration )every step of the way; and
2. comprehensive evidence-based justifications every step of the way

**aarogya setu compares unfavourably to singapore and mit**

https://preview.redd.it/0zw655ssbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=488f2ca51d6a194e6858495a346eb42e072a2d5b

consider the following aspects.

**is this for disease control or for other purposes?**

in other countries, health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to covid-19. for example, in singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited data/interaction which is shared with them. european authorities are making similar commitments. they assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein.

in india, multiple committees have been set up in the context of *aarogya setu* or other technology responses to the coronavirus. but formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the ministry of health and family welfare. instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players.

to protect people‚Äôs right to privacy, countries (including singapore) say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines. ***aarogya setu*** **retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure comply legal orders and so on**.

**minimisation? what minimisation?**

1. singapore monitors people‚Äôs interactions through bluetooth beacons, mit does it through gps, and **then there‚Äôs india which uses both**.
2. other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier. india‚Äôs aarogya setu **collects multiple data points** for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks.

&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/zy6tp8hvbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ea4b8aca61a8e38ec771f8ad785c5211b2bf17

https://preview.redd.it/mnrv4i6wbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23f8c169d0699880af385910b6ee8b4799d23955

**no transparency leads to discretion**

the only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian terms of service (tos) and privacy policy. other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency. this may include an accompanying manifesto, technical specifications, general faqs, and even its source code. not only does *aarogya setu* go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny, information security and other related research which help facilitate stability.

similarly, the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as covid-19 positive as admitted in the app‚Äôs terms of service. we ask in our report the question in our paper, does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test? similarly, does this mean that a false positive entails that i cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends? this evokes imagery of the chinese model of surveillance during covid-19 and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report.

**no accountability and no auditability**

the government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies. this means citizens cannot hold the government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the government‚Äôs processes are compliant with the right to privacy.

second, the government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a 30 day time period. however, as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion. this is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the government has deleted people‚Äôs personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend.

**risk of permanence and compromises to autonomy | the anonymisation gambit**

finally, the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture. people are describing the current times as 9/11 on steroids. and with 9/11 we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments. the government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review, delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the *aarogya setu* project. second, there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets. such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance.

finally, the government says that the tos and privacy policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets. the government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this. this level of transparency is a minimum, since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to people‚Äôs informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities. considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis, the government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny.

**conclusion**

iff has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies, and the paper eventually sets out a series of 17 recommendations to ensure people‚Äôs informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times, wherein indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought.

## tl;dr

with a view to address the public health challenges due to covid-19 a range of technology interventions are being developed that impact personal privacy. we at iff have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in india. ¬†this includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.

we devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications singapore‚Äôs tracetogether, mit‚Äôs private kit : safe path‚Äôs project and aarogya setu. we also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between apple and google towards contact tracing. ¬†to conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the indian supreme court‚Äôs developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. it's possible if we try!

## re-framing the privacy and public health trade-off

the world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. a reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the covid-19 pandemic. in these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.

however, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. this prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. at the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the covid virus. one such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the aarogya setu app by the government of india.

recognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by covid. this must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.

## overview of the working paper

this [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndopzygqyteteguolzula5o9y5f3f5yjdsa2pd99o6u/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. the first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. we have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. all three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.

following this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. this can be achieved by respecting a person‚Äôs autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. to illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications singapore‚Äôs tracetogether, mit‚Äôs private kit : safe path‚Äôs project and aarogya setu (pages 59-73) in section 7. we also look at the apple-google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.

finally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, ‚Äú.adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. it is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in india with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the covid-19 pandemic.‚Äù

## we have three primary objectives from this working paper

*a comprehensive map on covid technology interventions:* our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. this is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. we have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in india.

*breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. these are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. we hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.

*collaborative solutions for government:* we don't have all the answers. but, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to government authorities. to facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndopzygqyteteguolzula5o9y5f3f5yjdsa2pd99o6u/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. in addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**internet freedom forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).

## what does iff plan to do with this working paper?

we will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. so for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. this will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.

this working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. for instance we have already filed rtis to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. more action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.

yet minister of state of finance anurag thakur says ""no impact on economy"". nirmala doesn't care as she doesn't invest in stocks. modi is fakir aadmi. unsurprisingly chaddy gaumutra drinkers dont have any come back to this kind of facts.

not only has yes bank failed but with supreme court order on vodafone agr dues, this is likely to cause over 20,000 crore of npas on top banks, including sbi and indusind. it wont be surprising to see another bank fail and get saved by cashpayers money.

moreover vodafone a large international company failing due to goi greed will be death knell of foreign investments into india. imagine a govt so careless they allow such a large company such as vodafone to go bankrupt due to utter stupid policies. this govt has managed to destroy one of the most promising sectors telecom into a duopoly.

even liquid funds are crashing hard as even goi defaulting cannot be ruled out at this point. lot of rbi money has gone into cleaning up the mess created by demo, gst, saving private banks, etc. while other countries are announcing several billion dollars of corona relief, there is nothing really left in terms of relief to indian citizens.


during recession, you need actual economists like manmohan singh and raghuram rajan steering the ship, not war mongers like anurag thakur and nirmala tai.

### tl;dr

we wrote to the department of telecommunications and the ministry of parliamentary affairs to ensure reform of india‚Äôs internet shutdown laws remains a priority for the government. we have relied on the observations made by the supreme court in *anuradha bhasin v. union of india* about gaps in the telecom suspension rules 2017 to urge for review of the rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. 

### background

on 10 january 2020, the supreme court delivered its judgement *in anuradha bhasin v. union of india.* this case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in jammu and kashmir on 05 august 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in india‚Äôs internet shutdown framework. ¬†the court noted that the telecom suspension rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. as a temporary stop-gap measure, the court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. first, the court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. second, the court directed the review committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like jabalpur without any publication of order.

the government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *anuradha bhasin v. union of india* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the telecom suspension rules 2017. in response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/au600.pdf), the minister of state for communications stated in rajya sabha on 06 february 2020 that the government will review the rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the supreme court‚Äôs observations. to ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the department of telecommunications and the ministry of parliamentary affairs.   


### recommendations for department of telecommunications

we first wrote to the department of telecommunications under the ministry of communications on 06 february 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in india. in particular, we urged the department to commence a public consultation to review the telecom suspension rules 2017. we also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all states and union territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the supreme court in *anuradha bhasin v. union of india.*

noting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. we suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the cellular operators association of india estimating that telecom operators lose rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   


### recommendations for ministry of parliamentary affairs

we also wrote to the ministry of parliamentary affairs on 03 april 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the minister of state for communications in rajya sabha about review of telecom suspension rules 2017. as per the government of india (allocation of business) rules, 1961, the ministry of parliamentary affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before parliament. assurances made in parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. however, in this case, the department of telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the telecom suspension rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. 

we recognize that due to the covid-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the telecom suspension rules 2017 must remain a priority and the parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the ministry of communications.

# tl;dr

iff wrote to the jammu and kashmir government and ministry of home affairs seeking restoration of 4g internet services in kashmir during the covid 19 crisis. the region is already struggling to recover from the six month long shutdown imposed on 5 august 2019 and several of its key healthcare indicators are below the national average. therefore, immediate restoration of 4g internet services in the region is necessary to prevent spread of the virus through telemedicine and effective public outreach.

[\(screenshot of toi's tweet before it was deleted\)](https://preview.redd.it/qfb2xn7mkyo41.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed515e7a9ee26e760826e15eb81d154e0395548c)

&#x200b;

yesterday, the times of india tweeted that 4g internet services had been restored in jammu and kashmir but it subsequently deleted the tweet and published another [**article**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/times-fact-check/news/fake-alert-order-claiming-4g-internet-to-be-restored-in-jammu-alone-is-fake/articleshow/74814962.cms) about this information being false. this led to considerable confusion and it once again brought into sharp focus the continued deprivation of rights suffered by the people of jammu and kashmir.

while the rest of india transitions to work from home and relies on the internet to seek latest covid 19 information and stay in touch with loved ones, the internet is still being slowed down to 2g speed in jammu and kashmir. ¬†jammu and kashmir already has 7 confirmed covid 19 cases. with these figures expected to rise exponentially in the next few weeks, the government must make all tools including high speed internet available to doctors and patients to save lives. ¬†

# dashboards and chatbots for all

while responding to the covid 19 crisis, the indian government has embraced technology to disseminate accurate and updated information to panic struck citizens. take for instance, the ministry of health‚Äôs covid 19 dashboard which provides latest state-wise figures and guidelines for different stakeholders. the ministry of health and mygovindia have also collaborated with whatsapp to launch a chat box which will address queries of concerned citizens through text, infographics and video. even private players like apollo hospitals have developed tech tools which allow people to assess their risk of developing covid 19 through a mobile app. however, the residents of jammu and kashmir may be unable to access such life-saving information because the government is slowing down their internet speed to 2g which makes it very difficult to download videos and heavy files.

# telemedicine for all

the difficulty in communicating through video on a 2g internet connection also means that doctors in jammu and kashmir cannot use telemedicine. during pandemics, hospitals become hotbeds of infection and any effective containment strategy must limit the number of persons visiting hospitals. reducing the number of visitors in hospitals is only possible if doctors are able to remotely assess and monitor the condition of patients who do not require intensive care. however, remote consultations which require video facilities to visually examine the patient are practically impossible with slow 2g internet services.

healthcare is a fundamental right and accessing healthcare through the internet also enjoys constitutional protection. the essential nature of internet services during this period is also demonstrated by the ministry of home affairs classification of telecom and internet services as necessities during the 21 day lockdown. therefore, depriving the people of jammu and kashmir of meaningful internet connectivity during a pandemic is completely unconscionable and the government must immediately restore 4g services to reduce suffering and loss of life.

now coming to india, no political party in india has ever worked on the health infrastructure, other than a few marquee projects like building one or two aiims. this is the same for this government as well, however other governments failings do not justify this governments lack of action with regards to building health facilities. currently india has .8 doctors per thousand patients, which is well below recommended standard. i'm sure even this figure is inflated as of late the government has started to recognise or offering bridge programs to ayush doctors.

when the delhi state government, started to build mohalla clinics, then the current ruling national government tried it's best to stop their development, the d.d.a, which is controlled by the central government, didn't alot them any land, forcing mohalla clinics to be built on the side of the roads in porta cabins. as they were on the side of the roads they are cramped, such cramped atmosphere promoted for the spread of the disease. now the government knows that it's going to loose this war if a vaccine doesn't come out soon, and to be very frank a vaccine will take at least 12-18 months, so now the ruling dispensation is trying to divert attention on communal grounds, helped by the fact that one religious gathering carried the corona virus all over the country, in the same way that a religious community spread it in south korea.

the question is whether now this crisis plays a role in removing these leaders and making way for a more sensible breed of leadership or whether it strengthens their grip on power as has happened in hungary.

edit: i would also like to add that the current ruling dispensation in india also is trying to divert the entire attention to a particular sect that has spread the virus in india, it's doing so that it can divert attention from the mass exodus of migrant workers, and according to the governments own admission in the supreme court 1 in 3 people from that mass exodus have a very high probability of having covid19. couple that mass exodus of covid19 carriers with weakened immune system of massive malnourishment present in the rural populace, will result in a higher deaths rate even among a younger populace.

edit 2: now trump has stopped shipment of n95 masks, which was ment for and paid for by other countries. in fact a shipment of n95 which was just transiting through a u.s. port ""disappeared"", the shipment was heading to germany.

is trump crazy, he is isolating america and americans at their time of greatest needs. for example germany is a major industrial power, it may manufacturer components that are needed in circuit boards of ventilators, what if it stopped the shipment of those circuit boards? canada has already pointed out that a lot of all nurses go from windsor ontario to north american cities like detroit.

### tl;dr

iff has written an open letter to justice a.p. shah and shared a copy of it with the internet and mobile association of india (iamai). in it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. we have sent this as a response to three recent developments. first, the government filed a counter affidavit before the supreme court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. second, the minister of information & broadcasting prakash javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. third, hotstar india‚Äôs largest online curated content providers banned an episode of last week tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to indian prime minister narendra modi. therefore, we have written to justice shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the iamai‚Äôs self regulation code poses to people‚Äôs right to receive and impart information.

### background

in early february 2020, the internet and mobile association of india launched a new code for self regulation of online curated content providers. among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a digital content complaint council (‚Äúdccc‚Äù). the dccc has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the broadcast content complaints council (‚Äúbccc‚Äù) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in india. notably, the bccc and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. when such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. as we all know, india‚Äôs tv ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

we have studied the iamai‚Äôs self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to tv come up in this context as well. it establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the information technology act, 2000 and the indian penal code, 1860. in addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the dccc and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public‚Äôs right to free speech and expression.

we believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague india‚Äôs online content space. at a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in india‚Äôs fledgling online content ecosystem. sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**iamai** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed dccc, the former chief justice of the delhi high court, [**justice a.p. shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). in it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the dccc and the iamai‚Äôs self regulation code. to be sure, the code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the iamai in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. the exclusionary nature of the code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in india has more than 35 payers. therefore, it is concerning that the indian government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### latest developments

in an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the ministry of information and broadcasting (mib) filed a counter affidavit filed before the supreme court of india. in it mib [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. this concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the mumbai mirror dated march 03, 2020 revealed that the union minister for information and broadcasting mr prakash javadekar met with online content industry representatives. in the meeting, the minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. this is clearly indicative of a risk that the government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the iamai code and come under the jurisdiction of the dccc. if this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the indian television ecosystem.

our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the iamai‚Äôs self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of last week tonight with john oliver which was centred on indian prime minister narendra modi.

### what have we written?

given these multiple developments we have written to justice a.p. shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the iamai self-regulation code. we have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people‚Äôs freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. to this end, we have shared with both justice shah and the iamai governing council links to a recent report by [**access now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. the report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

iff will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

* several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including gst have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (source - [demonetisation, gst impact: india is fast ceding gold market share to china](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. demo paved the way for new acts such as the rera which further increase transparency. the immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (source - [demonetisation impact: real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). the real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability.

* direct tax collection has increased siginificantly due to demo. corporate income tax grew at 14% and personal income tax grew at 13%. net collections increased by 17.1% in fy18 and 14.6% in fy17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in fy16 to 1.3 times in fy17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in fy18.

**the bad:**

* labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. in the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. the unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says azim premji university report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* in the immediate aftermath of demo, msme's were the most badly affected. small businesses with no access to pos machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. this inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (source - [demonetisation: indian smes suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* the manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. the nikkei india manufacturing purchasing managers‚Äô index (pmi) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. the index of industrial production (iip) saw just a 4.9% growth in november, compared to 6.6 percent in october. (source - [demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/economy/demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. the ministry of agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (source - [demonetization: the impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/b1vftogwqhjdm5nkmg2cxj/demonetization-the-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* the rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. the pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the wholesale price index (wpi) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of demo. (source - [how demonetisation affected the indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/politics/ysbmktic4minsz1btccbjo/how-demonetisation-affected-the-indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* a systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. the performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (source - [indian demonetization and the liquidity conundrum](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as demo and gst further aggravated the issue. (source - [demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: us study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**the ugly:**

* the excercise led to the death of several people, and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population. i don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.

a couple more points i'd like to add:

* just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to demo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. the issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. i believe the main point of demo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). i believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. again, just my theory.
* i believe the true purpose of demo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of india **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** i do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

summing up, i'd like to point out that demo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. it has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. that's the point of my post. thanks for reading.please let me know if i missed anything and i'd be happy to update my post.",facts_and_figures,media sold out except select few,1206,5,6.820700896495517,7.8,honest

**tl;dr**

with reports now emerging that the delhi police is using drones to check for people who are breaking the curfew in delhi, we examine responses we have received in reply to right to information requests filed about the usage of drones in delhi in february. the delhi police admits to hiring drones for various purposes over the course of the last few months including the 2020 delhi legislative assembly elections and during the riots in north-east delhi. this is being done with no guidelines in place for their use and thus are not only a violation of the right to privacy of individuals but also a tool of mass surveillance in the hands of the government.  


**wait‚Ä¶ what?**

the delhi police has been using drones for surveillance of crowds for quite some time now. the first [**reports**](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/anti-caa-stir-delhi-police-use-drone-to-keep-track-of-protesters-1629729-2019-12-19) emerged in december, 2019 when it was reported that anti-caa protests had been surveilled via drones to keep a close eye on the protesters. this was in addition to the delhi police‚Äôs use of [**fa**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/)[**cial recognition technology**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/) to identify the protesters (read our previous blog post where we sent a notice to the delhi police to cease such use [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-the-delhi-police-stop-its-facial-recognition-system/)).  


subsequently, there were [**reports**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/from-facial-recognition-system-to-four-layer-security-delhi-police-gears-up-for-r-day-11579892354659.html) that the delhi police used drones on crowds during the republic day parade in january, 2020 to ‚Äúmaintain vigil‚Äù. in february, 2020 there were [**reports**](https://thewire.in/government/delhi-riots-police-special-commissioner) that the delhi police had used drones to ‚Äúmonitor the situation‚Äù during the riots in north-east delhi.   


now [**reports**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5146-held-in-delhi-for-defying-lockdown-1018-vehicles-seized/articleshow/74801660.cms) are emerging that the delhi police is using [**drones**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/covid-19-drones-used-to-enforce-lockdown-more-booked-for-violating-prohibitory-orders/articleshow/74831906.cms) to ensure that people do not violate the 21-day curfew imposed by the government in a bid to combat the spread of the covid-19 virus.   


**the delhi police confirms using drones**

on february 14, 2020, we filed a right to information request with the delhi police asking the following questions:

1. whether the delhi police has procured drones for any purpose?

2. details of the tender issued for such procurement.

3. information about the vendor from whom the drones were procured and the total expenditure incurred.

4. information with regard to the technical specifications of the drones.

5. whether these drones were deployed in december, 2019 and january, 2020?

6. any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures in place which govern the use of these drones by the delhi police.  


our request was transferred to various departments of the delhi police. we received replies from multiple departments denying any use of drones by them. however, in a reply dated march 13, 2020, the public information officer (pio) of the north-east district, seelampur, delhi police confirmed that they have been using drones. ¬†  


**here is a point-wise summary of their reply:**

1. the north-east district has **hired** drones for maintaining law and order.

2. since the drones have been hired, there was no tender which was issued for procurement.

3. the delhi police has been hiring drones from the open market through station house officers (sho).

4. the technical specifications of these hired drones are not available with the pio.

5. the pio confirmed that drones were used during the 2020 delhi legislative assembly election which were held on february 8, 2020 and during the riots in north-east delhi which began on february 23, 2020.

6. in response to the query asking whether there are any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedure governing the use of drones by the delhi police, the reply was ‚Äúno comment‚Äù.

&#x200b;

**why does this matter anyway?**

there are multiple problems in the way that drones are being used in delhi.

1. hiring drones instead of procuring through a publicly available tender diminishes the transparency of the whole exercise. as a result of not releasing a tender, we now have no information with regard to from whom these tenders are being hired, how much expenditure has been incurred and what is the scope of their use.

2. since there are no publicly available guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures with regard to the use of drones, this whole process is shrouded in opacity. there is no information as to how these drones are being used, who is authorized to use them, who has access to the information gathered and how this information is being processed. ¬†  


**so what now?**

iff has consistently been against use of such invasive technology especially in a [**legal vacuum**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/). the only [**regulations**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=183093) for drones in india are those which subsist for commercial purposes and which have been developed by the directorate general of civil aviation (dgca). drones are being used in delhi without any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures which have been made publicly available. it is our opinion that use of such technology can never be justified if not done in a transparent manner. we urge the delhi police to make any such guidelines, if they exist, publicly available. if not, we urge the delhi police to immediately cease such use. this is because even in extraordinary times such as these, we have to ensure that basic fundamental rights, such as privacy, are not the scapegoats which have to be sacrificed for the purported greater good.

Policy/Economy,"the need to investigate the nso group, which was behind the pegasus software, is now more than ever.",70,fyawr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fyawr9/the_need_to_investigate_the_nso_group_which_was/,4,2020-04-10 20:55:37,"&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/p3vb8eexzxr41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80eb8a5aafc7092e4017557ca41921f18c872f1

**tl;dr**

according to a hindustan times [**report**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/pegasus-creator-nso-group-has-a-covid-19-software-why-you-should-be-worried/story-smsyxkfoz9opg2vbikra8l.html) dated april 07, 2020, the nso group has created a surveillance application to track covid-19 infected patients which they have been actively pitching to almost a dozen governments around the world to use. this is the same company which was behind the pegasus software that was used to hack the whatsapp applications of a substantial number of indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in may and june of 2019. mindful of the potential harms of this covid-19 application being used by the indian government, we wrote to the chief ministers of maharashtra and chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the whatsapp hack. our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   


**what happened?**

last year on may 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the financial times for the first time reported that whatsapp, ‚Äúdiscovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iphones and android phones by ringing up targets using the app‚Äôs phone call function.‚Äù as per a statement by whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. on october 30, 2019, indian express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in india were mostly indian journalists and human rights activists. of these a significant number are situated in maharashtra and chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the bhima-koregaon case in maharashtra and dalit activists in chhattisgarh.   


**what is the law related to hacking?**

surveillance such as this which was carried through the pegasus software developed by the nso group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. this goes against the decision in j*ustice k.s. puttaswamy vs union of india* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   


additionally, the information technology act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. under s. 66 of the act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  


**attempts at reputation laundering by the nso group**

we are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the nso group in india. it was reported in the hindustan times on april 07, 2020 that nso has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the covid-19 virus. the report also said that the nso group ¬†is ‚Äúactively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.‚Äù   


it was not made clear whether nso has approached the indian government. however, since the nso group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**the coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors ¬†like the nso group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  


**our recommendations**

1. we recommend that the state governments of maharashtra and chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
2. the committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the state governments.
3. the committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
4. the committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
5. the committee should facilitate the registration of open firs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
6. the committee should operate in a transparent manner.   


**important documents**

but, my sister recently had a baby and when i met her mil she gave me a packet telling me they were medicines for my sister. i gave them to my sis and she asked my why i am giving her [this](https://i.imgur.com/qvkmkzq.png). i was baffled and eventually realized this was the ""corona vaccine"". i told her to ignore it and she did. 

now i did some googling to find out what this mess is all about.

Policy/Economy,here's my side of the story as a small businessman,27,fw7gcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw7gcl/heres_my_side_of_the_story_as_a_small_businessman/,6,2020-04-07 10:59:46,"this is going to be long. i would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. thank you for your attention in advance. 

i'm not sure what to flair this post as. i'm on a throwaway account that i may or may not continue using and i just want to share my side of the story while i sit here in loneliness watching random videos on youtube just to get my mind off of things. and with no sign of sleep at all.

>about me & my partners

i'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the indian startup ecosystem to start my business. i'm also a college dropout by choice so i don't have a graduate degree but i really loved the business we were running. me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and i feel responsible for them. one of them quit his safe cushy job when i messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. i'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and i acknowledge that.

>our business - what we do

our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. we're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. think of it in a way that i'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. i loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>how has the lockdown affected my business?

being a new business we were almost breakeven. most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. we had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why i said almost breakeven) and i was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. we had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

this worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

in january when i read about the first covid-19 case in india, i was scared. things got bad real soon around the world. with every passing day i was worried more and more about what i was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. i checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

but the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. the main part of this whole thing was shipping which i had taken so much pain to setup.

one thing i learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why india with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. it's because the vendors are lazy. even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. and i'm not talking about overtime or anything.. just their normal work cycle. they are not serious about it at all.

i had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. we had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. within a month i was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. i couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which i couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

i wrote all this because when my city got the first few covid-19 cases, i started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. we were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now i have an inventory of products that is ready to go but i cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. my shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of india.

i'm now in a sea of uncertainty where i have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever i have in the business account right now.

>the finances

i'm not even worried about the money, i'm worried about the inventory i have, i'm worried about the payment disputes i need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside india. for every payment dispute i lose, i lose $15 extra. the money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. the money for the raw materials are to be paid and i'm refunding customers everyday. losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that i might have earned.

>what do i mean exactly? 

now, i'm all for life>money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, i'm going insane. i'm having panic attacks, i don't know what i will do next. i used to have a plan for everything, now i don't. i'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. my head hurts all the time, i sleep for a few hours and when i wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

i'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than i am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. i'm not sadistic.

i have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

but i feel responsible and i'm not able to calm down. anxiety is on its peak for me right now and i have no plans to save us from this.

i come to this sub daily and i actively participate in discussions and disses but i haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

i'm scared guys, i'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

i'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

Policy/Economy,overpopulation - how i would go about trying to fix it,1,fz16t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz16t8/overpopulation_how_i_would_go_about_trying_to_fix/,21,2020-04-11 23:02:32,"by 2050, we are projected to add a further ~300mn more to our current 1.3bn to reach a total of 1.7bn. quality of life issues are further exacerbated because of income/wealth inequality, as we're seeing played out in the coivd-19 crisis. this problem is not limited to india alone, as all of south asia has gone/is going through the same boom, putting further pressure on limited resources in the region. 

political parties don't want to touch this issue, and for good reason - india has a dark past with population ""control"". the indian state, further, cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the chinese state had in the past (one child policy). in any event, i personally believe people have an inalienable right to do what they want with their bodies, whether that means having 5 children or no children. 

in my view, what's required are policies that are geared towards rewarding those who don't have children, in addition to current policies encouraging contraception. participation will be totally voluntary. the following can be awarded to people who undertake to remain childless:-

1. government issues bonds that mature in 30/40/50 years. it could be called the bonds issued to childless hedonists (**bitch**). at maturity, this bond will be worth what the market dictates will be required to retire at 65. instead of a child maturing and taking care of its parents, the bond will. the corpus will be funded through borrowings raised on the basis of the savings the state is projected to make through decreased spending on public welfare services. 

2. alternatively, government could also make a one time cash payment that would be further significantly less than the value of the proposed bond at maturity.

3. in lieu of cash payments/bond issues, government could award agricultural land to childless persons. the value of the land proposed to be awarded will have to be the same for all awardees.

4. medals/certificates/government mandated public approval. i personally don't care for this, but most people do. in any event, indian society across the board seems to view childless people with suspicion.

5. encouraging adoption through the policies noted earlier. i think this could work, but is also very open to abuse (people adopting orphans for payouts/child abuse already prevalent in adopted children), so any execution would have to be subject to rigorous control. 

6. school/university education geared towards encouraging childlessness. it's clear that resources need to be consumed more efficiently, but even at peak efficiency, resources will be consumed. the best way to reduce one's environmental impact would be to not have children.

i want to make it clear that these policies will be totally voluntary - there is no hint of coercion. however, in order to ensure participants remain childless, there will likely a degree of enforcement required. for instance, participants will have to undergo vasectomies/tubal ligations. naturally, government will have to create a framework to follow up on continued childlessness of participants. having said that, government already has full knowledge of parents/children through its aadhar database. further, all participants will be subject to a vetting process to ensure that there is no coercion by people looking to make a buck off human misery.

i actually think there will be an uptick of cases in the next few weeks what with all the clapping nonsense and dancing in the streets and now this rampaging through the commercial areas and crowding, and totally erratic behavior all round and the shite show with the police beating up everybody on plain sight without empathizing with people who might actually have a valid reason to be outside.

i mean i get the bit about lockdowns, but half the time, its just a shite-show with all the ppl running to the stores, crowding up and being very erratic overall and i am not criticizing that, as that is perfectly understandable, we never know what these ppl are going through, it could be an essential for their ailing grandparents or their cancer stricken child, but does anybody think the lockdowns are almost always haphazard in their execution, and it seems to be defeating the purpose of it all.

some of the success stories like taiwan, hk, and even south korea, its more about social distancing, and wearing masks at all times and practicing good hygiene especially around the elderly, and finally controlling the inbound and outbound flights and treating the airports as ground zero and being very vigilant with the quarantine, hongkong implemented trackers for all incoming passengers with threat of serious consequences i.e fines and even solitary confinement,  and it seems to have worked a treat. lockdowns were not really implemented as they thought it would be counter productive and stores and super markets and public transportation facilities  were kept open 24x7 with a condition that only 30% of the capacity allowed at any given time, which was actually sensible rather than shutting down everything or having limited operating hours which just creates a mad rush and totally counter productive. 

yeah, i honestly think a lot of countries have never faced a situation like this. uncharted territory really, but looking at the success stories like south korea and hk, and even taiwan, and replicating the exact same strategies would have gone a long way, instead of haphazardly implementing draconian counter-productive strategies that have not been thought through. (shades of demo all over again, what with the initial applauding by the upper middle class who can just sit at home and play in their ps4, the average redditor here, and then slowly waking up and smelling the coffee as the hours tick by)

before i get started, i want to clarify i am not criticizing any of two approach. this is comparison with respect to what is currently considered best practice. i understand circumstances limit how well it can be copied in india.

**testing**

india: must be international traveler or have come in contact with infected person. recently, pneumonia cases are also allowed to be tested.

korea: anyone can get tested. if you have any symptoms, you call a number, they direct you to nearest center. a doctor check you and if symptoms match, you get test for free. additionally, if   you come in contact of any infected person, you get test for free. if you are just worried and want to get tested, you pay ~120$.

**treatment cost**

india: i have no information on this.

korea: ~40$ if you have national insurance. ~1400$ if you don't. all citizens have it. ~50% foreigners have it.*

**shut down**

korea: there is no broad shut down. large gatherings (events, protest, etc.), religious congregations and karaoke are banned.#

india: ya all know.

**delivery**

india: shit show.
korea: no limitation what so ever. encouraged.

personal comment: why the f govt. cares if someone want to order non essential stuff from amazon?

**tracking & isolation**

india: wholesale isolation of anyone and everyone. release excel files and put stickers, broadcasting the isolation of person/household.

korea: if you are coming from covid infected area, you must isolated for 14 days.^ if someone is found to be infected, his movement are traced and made public. if you live in same district or have visited it, you get message informing you off same. you can check the same online for each individual patient. 

**business**

india: shut down everything with limited exception.

korea: no restriction. if someone is found to be infected, it is shut down for disinfection and things are back on soon.

**wfh**

india: idk how common is this

korea: encouraged but not very common. schools are closed, university is online.

let us first understand, what is article 360.

article 360 in the constitution of india is for imposing a nationwide financial emergency in india.

financial emergency (article 360):
article 360 states that if the president is satisfied that a situation has arisen whereby the financial stability or the credit of india or any part thereof is threatened, the president may declare a state of financial emergency.
during the period such proclamation is in operation, the executive authority of the union extends to the giving of directions to any state to observe such canons of financial propriety as may be specified in the directions, any such directions may also include:
a provision required the reduction of salaries and allowances of all or any class of person serving a state or the union.
a provision requiring all money bills or other financial bills to be reserved for the consideration of the president after they are passed by the legislature of the state.
a proclamation issued under article 360 will remain in force for two months unless before the expiry of the period it is approved by both the houses of the parliament.
a proclamation issued under article 360 will remain in force for two months unless before the expiry of the period it is approved by both the houses of the parliament.
once approved it remains in force till revoked by the president.
no emergency under article 360 has been issued so far.

india had been going through one of the worst phases of the financial crisis in its 72 years of history, india‚Äôs top 3 rating agencies like fitch, moody‚Äôs and s&p have already reduced india‚Äôs growth gdp to the lowest marks much before corona.

now, this corona epidemic would have a long lasting & frightening effect on the indian economy which might push india almost 70 years back similar to the partion era. let‚Äôs connect the dots altogether.

1. the reserve bank of india has already made a war room with 90 people keeping an eye on the indian economy which has never been done earlier in the entire history of the reserve bank.

2. foreign investors pulled out 1.08 lakh crore rupees from indian market in just 15 trading sessions

3. almost 80% of the indian companies are asking their employees to work from home, many companies including go air & air india have asked their staff to go on unpaid leaves, most companies have also terminated several employees.

4. almost 80% of the major financial centers of the country are in lockdown including bangalore, mumbai, pune, delhi, lucknow, kanpur, hyderabad, jaipur, chennai, kolkatta, gurgaon, noida, ahemdabad, surat.

5. us dollor has the all time highest value against indian currency, at the time of writing this article 1:53 am midnight 23 march 2020, 1 usd was equal to 75.62.

6. corona cases in india at the time of writing this article has reached 415.

7. several sectors including hotels, restaurants, night clubs, bars, airlines, bpo, tourism, entertainment & bollywood, auto-mobile, aviation, hospitality, apparel, consumer durables and electronics, poultry and seafood, construction, transport, railway are worst hit by this epidemic.

8. several associated sectors also had a huge impact on their revenues like oil-petrol, security service industry and many others whose revenues are directly & indirectly dependent on the above sectors.

9. coronavirus infection is spreading like fire and indian agencies would not be able to control it in the near future, if by any chance, it enters into the fourth stage, which it is most likely to enter due to citizens ignorance, it would be the worst crisis in the entire history of independent india.

10. right now coronavirus is only among rich & elite who are able to handle the financial burdens & have multiple resources in terms of healthcare, work, financial savings and can still to self isolate & prevent it from spreading but once it enters into people under below poverty line, it would almost be impossible to control it and a large chunk of india‚Äôs revenue would be invested to handle the situation.

11. the reserve bank stored funds including the contingency funds & emergency funds have already depleted after rbi gave multiple chunks of large money to the current government.

12. several private & government banks in india have the highest npa and loan defaulters doesn‚Äôt seem to be in any mood to be paying it off soon.

13. the share markets of india, including the national stock exchange (nse) & bombay stock exchange (bse) are continuously falling.

connecting all the points from 1 to 13

Policy/Economy,extensive testing is an insurance to avoid lockdown,15,fwh7oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwh7oa/extensive_testing_is_an_insurance_to_avoid/,4,2020-04-07 22:31:35,"singapore just had a spike of 120 cases yesterday because of a couple of dormitories. it seems like a small spark can cause a fire.

one of the main tools to resume partial economy for any country after the lockdown is aggressive testing and tracing until there is a treatment or vaccine. several people think scaling up testing is not necessary which makes me sad. i am going to make an insurance-like case for that taking india as a case.

some back of the envelope calculation:

cost of a test: upto 60$ (in india)
doing 500,000 tests per day for 100 days would cost $3 billion.

this sounds like a lot... until we look at the cost of lockdown which is ~ $120 billion for 3 weeks. so, basically with the cost of a single day of lockdown we should be able to test 500,000 people everyday for 200 days. and there seems to be reasonable confidence in science community that we may have a safe and effective drug for treatment by then.

there can be different strategies for how we will pick people for the 500k tests per day and that's a later discussion. i am more concerned about getting extensive test coverage so we can detect outbreaks early and do a much finer grained lockdown than a blunt country-wide lockdown. basically, pay a small cost to avoid another lockdown in the future.

ps1: note that the cost of test will likely go down significantly (say an order of magnitude) if we scale up.

Policy/Economy,an honest thought on how india could economically prosper,11,frks4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frks4g/an_honest_thought_on_how_india_could_economically/,10,2020-03-30 18:42:17,"this thought has been bothering me for sometime so maybe if i share it here, it might provide me some relief.  
before i go further, i‚Äôd like to re-iterate again that this is just a thought & there maybe several ways to improve upon it.  
  
firstly every citizen should be liable to pay direct tax. if it‚Äôs a farmer, poor person, any working adult should pay a measly suggested sum of say ‚Çπ10 **per fiscal year** as their share of tax.  

how would this help?  
  
first things first, we are too large a nation not to collect any direct tax from the vast majority of the people. i understand rich people pay more tax but only so much tax can be collected from them. i think the government may have stretched their limits here because increasing any rate on them would eventually funnel more money through their backdoors (black money, foreign tax havens).  
also, it‚Äôs no hidden fact that the majority of black money is generated from agricultural activities which are not liable to report any income since they are fully exempt. politicians & rich businessman funnel a lot of money through this buy showing part of their income from agricultural land.

## tl; dr:

on 5th february, 2020 the internet and mobile association of india (iamai) announced the launch of its code for self regulation of online curated content providers. among other things it provides the basis for the creation of the digital content complaint council (along the lines of a similar system in place for tv) to oversee content creation and distribution in the online video streaming space. although there are only four signatories (as opposed to nine in the case of a previous iteration), there are rumbling that the group is seeking government endorsement of this initiative. we have written to the iamai and copied the letter to both the union ministries of information & broadcasting; and electronics and information technology highlighting how this will lead to self-censorship to the detriment of internet users, creators, producers and competition within the market. based on these grounds we have asked the industry body to roll back the code and asked government authorities to refrain from endorsing the framework.

## background

this post is to update everyone that there is a risk brewing in india‚Äôs online video streaming space. and said risk could see us sleep walk into a scenario where online content in india, mimics its formulaic television counterpart. on 5th february 2020, at its annual india digital summit, the internet and mobile association of india (iamai) launched its *code for self-regulation of online curated content providers*. it follows up an earlier *code of best practices for online curated content providers* the industry body had ¬†put out in january 2019.

unlike the previous code which had nine signatories, the latest iteration has just four signatories namely, hotstar, voot, jio and sonyliv. prior signatories including netflix, zee5, altbalaji, arre and erosnow were conspicuously absent at the new code‚Äôs launch. other major players like amazon (prime) and google (youtube premium) have stayed away from the process since its inception. considering india has more than 35 online video streaming providers, the code is not really representative of the entire industry‚Äôs position. so then why are we concerned if it is only being carried out by such a small number of players?

## our take: this is a precursor to self-censorship and for online streaming to go down the path of tv

simply put it is the first step towards broad basing self-censorship as industry practice in india‚Äôs online video streaming space. if that is indeed the outcome, it would adversely impact internet users in india, creators, artists, production companies and so on. it is also likely to harm competition, innovation, investment and would facilitate industry capture by a few firms over the ecosystem.

the framework essentially builds on the original code of best practices through some key changes. first and most importantly, it seeks to establish an independent enforcement authority called the digital content complaint council (dccc) to oversee a signatory‚Äôs content related practices. this dccc mechanism is eerily similar and largely derivative of the [**broadcast content complaints council (bccc)**](https://www.ibfindia.com/sites/default/files/guidelines--term%20of%20broadcas%20changes.pdf) (under the indian broadcasting foundation) which essentially governs content on non-news and television channels in india.

we all know what that has meant to indian television and how that has led to a largely homogenous content ecosystem, inundated by typical saas-bahu programming devoid of much creativity or pathos. moreover, how often do we watch our favourite international content on tv and get bummed out that a large chunk of the programming has been edited out? in this context, the online video streaming space was a breadth of fresh air for indian audiences who were fans of global and local storytelling. further, it provided opportunities to local storytellers who had until then been rejected by traditional television, theatrical and radio media.

## the legal basis and policy need for this effort is questionable at best

in this context, it is disconcerting that even though there is no legal mechanism which empowers the dccc, its ties with the government are undeniable. the proposed dccc is meant to be chaired by a retired high court or supreme court judge. also, the dccc is designed to include three members from national level statutory commissions like the national commission for women (ncw), the national commission for protection of child rights (ncpcr) ¬†or the national human rights commission (nhrc). its composition would also facilitate incumbent business capture as the dccc is meant to include three industry representatives and two online curated content providers (likely to be signatories to the code). considering the opaque manner (with no public/stakeholder inputs) in which the code has been developed, and the public facing impact such a privately designed framework can have-- the legal validity of this effort remains dubious at best.

second, such codified structures essentially provide the government a parallel avenue with little to no legal accountability to apply pressure on businesses to censor people‚Äôs views and beliefs. it erodes channels for dissent and satire-- and is arguably incompatible with the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under the constitution of india.

third, like the previous code on best practices, the new code for self-regulation talks about ‚Äúprohibited content‚Äù. what is particularly dangerous is that the newest draft has been modified in a manner which makes the grounds for censorship vaguer. this would afford the dccc with more discretion to remove certain speech/content which would otherwise be legal under the constitution of india and also applicable laws like the information technology act, 2000 and the indian penal code, 1860. ¬†this is compounded by the fact that the dccc does not envision membership of stakeholders from research, academia or free speech backgrounds, to act as a safeguard for people‚Äôs right to receive and impart information. therefore, it may be concluded that this code is merely a liability reduction initiative which is being pushed through at the cost of plurality, diversity and creativity-- all cornerstone‚Äôs of the right to free speech and expression.

## tl;dr

iff has been tracking various facial recognition technology (frt) projects in different stages of development all over india. in the first part of this three part series on frt, we have mapped major frt projects in different states and broadly classified them into two categories according to intended purpose: security/surveillance and authentication of identity.

## the government needs to calm down!

in 2015, [**jacky alcine**](https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/615329515909156865) was surprised to find an auto-generated album in his google photos folder which contained a photo of his african-american friends categorized as ‚Äúgorillas.‚Äù this categorization had been done by the facial recognition software that google photos used to automatically sort any photos uploaded by the user. after jacky posted this image on twitter, the resultant outrage was immediate and understandable and google promptly removed the offending categorization.

in order to understand why this error occurred and why many civil liberties organizations are calling for a ban or a moratorium on frt, we need to understand how machine learning occurs and how bias in the samples used will lead to bias in the recognition done by the software. however, even before understanding these important questions and trying to come up with workable solutions and standards, the central government and different state governments have already started deploying frt for two major purposes: security/surveillance and authentication of identity.

## facial recognition for security/surveillance

one of the biggest causes of alarm currently is the [**request for proposals (rfp)**](http://ncrb.gov.in/tenders/afrs/rfp_nafrs.pdf) issued by the national crime records bureau (ncrb). the rfp invites bids for the creation of a national automated facial recognition system (afrs) which would be used to create a national database of photographs which would help in swiftly identifying criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like passport, cctns , icjs and prisons, wcd ministry's khoyapaya, nafis or any other image database available with police/other entity.

while this national level project is still in nascent stages, police departments of various states are already in possession of frt developed by public and/or private developers such as:

7. [**facetagr in tamil nadu**](https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-acquire-face-detecting-app/article23410231.ece)

we have already sent a notice to the delhi police over their illegal use of frt during the recent protests in delhi ([**read about it here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-the-delhi-police-stop-its-facial-recognition-system/)). in telangana as well, there have been multiple instances where police officers have been illegally asking individuals to submit their biometrics.

simultaneously, the ministry of railways has announced its own facial recognition based security/surveillance system called [**internet protocol (ip) based video surveillance system (vss)**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=197330) to be provided by railtel under the nirbhaya fund. the south western railway started implementing the first phase of this project, and it has stated [**in a press release**](https://swr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_detail.jsp?lang=0&dcd=3370&id=0,4,268) that it has been successful in developing a suitable facial recognition system which has 100% success rate in acquisition and matching of faces.

## facial recognition for authentication of identity

[**in a press release**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=183958), the ministry of civil aviation announced the digi yatra programme which primarily aims to increase the ease and efficiency with which passengers at airports are processed from the moment they step into the airport till they board their flight by making the whole process paperless and using the biometrics (face) of the passenger as their boarding pass. the government has already started rolling out digi yatra on a trial basis in different airports like [**hyderabad**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/hyderabad-airport-launches-face-recognition-system-for-entry-on-pilot-basis-1562059587608.html) (july 2018), [**delhi**](https://www.medianama.com/2019/12/223-face-recognition-digiyatra/) (september 2018) and [**bengaluru**](https://scroll.in/article/929851/facial-recognition-as-airports-in-india-start-using-the-technology-how-will-it-be-regulated) (december 2018).

recently, the [**telangana state election commission**](https://tsec.gov.in/pdf/ulbs_mplts/circulars/2020/cir_no_111_tsec-ulbs_2020_dated_18.01.2020_1401.pdf) also came up with a similar idea to counter impersonation in polls. tsec with the help of the telangana state technology services tested frt in 10 polling stations in kompally municipality of medchal malkajgiri district by using the technology to verify the identity of voters by comparing the photographs taken at the polling station with photographs of the voters in the tsec database.

frts are increasingly being used by educational institutions to verify the presence of teachers and students. the [**gujarat government**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-gujarat-new-system-of-teachers-attendance-through-face-recognition-5975585/) has introduced a frt system with a geo-tagging feature which ensures that primary school teachers themselves are present in schools and they are not being replaced by unauthorized and unqualified ‚Äúproxy‚Äù teachers. elsewhere in tamil nadu, the government higher secondary school in triplicane has installed a camera which is equipped with frt in order to mark attendance of students. similarly, iit delhi also has a frt enabled attendance app in place which is called timble.

the most recent use of frt for authentication of identity that we came across is proposed use of the technology by the maharashtra government in order to record who avails its shiv bhojan scheme. shiv bhojan¬†is a scheme aimed for impoverished sections of society, wherein in select locations around mumbai, the government will serve thalis of food at a nominal rate of rs.10.

## fighting back against frt

frt projects are becoming dangerously popular in india with various national level projects (afrs, digiyatra and ip vss) underway. however, all these projects have been implemented without any legislative framework governing their operation. be that as it may, the most worrisome part is not just the implementation of a faulty frt system but also the implementation of an accurate system which could become a tool of mass surveillance. these problems will be discussed in the next part of this series.

to counter this grave threat to the privacy of all indians, iff has taken various steps. we have sent legal notices to ncrb and delhi police against use of frt without any statutory basis or procedural safeguards. we have also filed right to information requests in conjunction to every such instance of frt that we have come across. we will keep you updated as and when we receive responses to our rti requests.

Policy/Economy,an open letter to justice a.p. shah on the online video self-regulatory code,186,f34zc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f34zc2/an_open_letter_to_justice_ap_shah_on_the_online/,28,2020-02-13 18:50:06,"tl; dr:

last week the the internet and ¬†mobile association of india (iamai) announced the launch of its code for self regulation of online curated content providers. this code industry wide code is signed by just 4 online video streaming providers and is intended to apply to the entire sector. it will require self-censorship practices which are there in the television sector to be implemented for online video streaming services such as arre, amazon prime, mx player and netflix. the code also creates a private body called the digital content complaint ¬†council (dccc) to judge complaints and impose penalties. as per [**press reports**](https://www.livemint.com/industry/media/hotstar-voot-others-sign-up-to-form-complaints-council-for-ott-platforms-11580907470733.html) it will be headed by justice a.p. shah who is a steadfast defenders of civil liberties and democratic values. with a view to place the several concerns of institutionalized self-censorship and chilling effects, we wrote him an open letter yesterday.

## in detail

in the past [**we have repeatedly warned**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) of the dangers of a dangerous self-censorship system for online video services that is being championed by the internet and mobile association of india (""iamai""). this system is called the, ""code for self regulation of online curated content providers"" and we have [**in detail explained how this will cause tremendous damage**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) to artistic creativity, user choice and innovation in the video streaming sector. this essentially institutionalises a dangerous tv style self-censorship system that will have a chilling effect on the diversity of content and programming.

this ""self regulatory"" code also creates a judicial body with what is called as a, ""tier 2"" for adjudicating any complaints on the content of the shows which are aired on online video streaming services. this body is called the digital content complaint council (""dccc"") and when the intial complaints to the signatories of this code (which are online streaming companies) are not settled, it hears them as a judicial case. it also will determine complaints sent by government departments and also can take suo-motu action. such powers are generally modeled from the broadcast content complaint council (""bccc"") that is a body for television broadcasters in india. the results of such practices in the tv sector are for everyone to see (*or, due to censorship not see*).

as per [**media reports**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) the first chairperson of the dccc is the distinguished jurist and the retired chief justice of the delhi high court, hon'ble justice (retd.) mr. a.p. shah. we hold justice shah in the highest regard for his intellect and courage in being a consistent voice for democratic rights - [**especially media freedoms**](https://www.livemint.com/leisure/x3es2gcvzvuzbyqwiwmqun/justice-ap-shah--judge-of-the-brave.html). due to the lack of response by the iamai we, yesterday sent an open letter to justice shah highlighting our concerns and prior correspondence. this is in our continuing effort that self-censorship practices that have made tv broadcast an arid medium do not migrate to the internet. our letter to justice shah is a good faith effort. while we have the highest faith in his ability to adjudicate and hold this position while protecting free expression. however, the larger, industry wide model that is being institutionalized and is likely to be cemented that will last beyond his term is injurious.

i just compiled some open data on the amount of public healthcare facilities in indian states, relative to the states' wealth and population.

the short report with some more details is at [the new website](http://datashri.com/indian_states_government_hospitals.html) but i am posting the important images below. hope you like it.

&#x200b;

the correlation between state net domestic product and the number of hospital beds, as well the correlation between state population and number of hospital beds is about 0.8 each. furthermore, the correlation between the per capita income of the state and the number of hospital beds is about -0.2 - so, to a certain limited extent, states with more rich people have fewer public health facilities.

>a.w. phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation. phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the united kingdom over a period of almost a full century (1861-1957), and he¬†discovered that the latter could be explained by (a) the level of unemployment¬†and (b) the rate of change of unemployment.

>phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high¬†and there are few unemployed workers, employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly. however, when demand for labor is low,¬†and unemployment is high, workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate, and as a result, wage rates fall very slowly.

>a¬†second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment. if business is booming, employers will bid more vigorously for workers, which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast¬†pace (i.e., percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly), than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing (e.g., percentage unemployment is unchanging) or only increasing at a slow pace.

does this mean the current government's quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up .

low inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest . however during times of inflation , investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal .

during congress years of 2004-2014 , high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure. since a large sector of indian economy is dependent on internal consumption , it experienced significant growth due to it 


the reserve bank of india has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation . many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high , as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures


>as these examples of hyperinflation show, states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check. for the past century in the u.s., the approach has been to manage inflation using¬†monetary policy. to do so, the¬†federal reserve¬†(the u.s.¬†central bank)¬†relies¬†on the relationship between¬†inflation and interest rates. if¬†interest rates¬†are low, companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business, earn a degree, hire new workers, or buy a shiny new boat. in other words, low rates encourage spending and investing, which generally stoke inflation in turn.by raising interest rates, central banks can put a damper on these rampaging¬†animal spirits

Sports,timing of dhoni's stint with the army and amrapali group sham leak,683,chze6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/chze6i/timing_of_dhonis_stint_with_the_army_and_amrapali/,129,2019-07-26 20:09:21,"just going through the news and following cricket, i would like to put forth a timeline of events to bring about an unbiased conclusion, so here goes the timeline

- dhoni doesn't retire post wc, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- statement from rhiti sports(dhoni owned and manages him and other csk) and later on selection panel that dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post wc.

- in the immediate few days after this,  audit report of amrapali group is analysed as part of sc case against the group. audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and rhiti sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, sports agency and now news even linking the bcci head shashank manohar (what??)

- [side event] byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing oppo. no tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for bcci. 

## conclusion

- if you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by sports agency or dhoni to announce the army stint before the amrapali sham comes out to the media. also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). how far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other indian player greats including sachin, yuvraj, sehwag, clean as hell dravid, ganguly have over courted as many controversies as dhoni. the clout that dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in ipl even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (byjus and all the above).

1) shooting is very unpredictable sport but this time we have many fearless youngsters who are performing exceptionally well. we should win more than 3 medals at least if all goes well. our best chances are in events like 10m air pistol (both men & women), 10m air rifle (both men & women) and mixed air pistol & mixed air rifle team event. you can check performance of our shooting team here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_issf_world_cup

2) mirabai chanu is most certain to win a medal for us at tokyo. at recently concluded world championship she finished at fourth place with chinese occupying top 2 spots. but in weightlifting, a country can only send one athlete in olympics so that means mirabai will be 3rd at worst. she is currently 13 kg ahead from her nearest competitor https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_world_weightlifting_championships_%e2%80%93_women%27s_49_kg

3) i think everyone here is aware about sindhu's badminton exploits. so i won't explain too much. we can also win a surprise medal in men's singles.

4) in wrestling, vinesh phogat & bajrang punia is most certain to win a medal for us. we can also win one or two medals from wrestling if we get a favourable draw. check our wrestling performance from ongoing world championship https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_world_wrestling_championships

5) amit panghal is a favourite to win a medal in boxing. he is current asian games & asian championship gold medalist. he has recently won a silver in world championship. there were 3 other indian boxer who were in qf at world championship. i'm slightly unsure about india's chances in women's boxing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_aiba_world_boxing_championships

outside of these 5 sports, we have half-chances to win a medal in few other sports like archery, hockey, golf and tennis. i'm not expecting any medals from athletics. only niraj chopra can finish inside top 5 in athletics event.

this is my own assessment. please tell me if i'm missing some other medal contenders.",gauravxm,hope realise typing online forum,367,6,5.28686327077748,6.333333333333333,assessment olympics contingent excited chances rio olympics sadly unlucky there heartbroken last olympics following olympics sports closely last 4 years feel time genuinely finish 10 medals if luck favour predictions 1 shooting unpredictable sport time many fearless youngsters performing exceptionally well win 3 medals least goes well best chances events 10m air pistol both men women 10m air rifle both men women mixed air pistol mixed air rifle team event check performance shooting team en wikipedia org wiki 2019_issf_world_cup mirabai chanu certain win medal us tokyo recently concluded world championship finished fourth place chinese occupying top spots weightlifting country send athlete olympics means mirabai 3rd worst currently 13 kg ahead nearest competitor en wikipedia org wiki 2019_world_weightlifting_championships_ e2 80 93_women 27s_49_kg 3 think everyone aware sindhu badminton exploits explain much win surprise medal men singles 4 wrestling vinesh phogat bajrang punia certain win medal us win two medals wrestling favourable draw check wrestling performance ongoing world championship en wikipedia org wiki 2019_world_wrestling_championships 5 amit panghal favourite win medal boxing current asian games asian championship gold medalist recently silver world championship 3 boxer qf world championship slightly unsure chances women boxing en wikipedia org wiki 2019_aiba_world_boxing_championships outside 5 sports half chances win medal sports archery hockey golf tennis expecting medals athletics niraj chopra finish inside top 5 athletics event assessment please tell missing medal contenders

these items not necessarily comes under essential goods but i think its still not right. when i ask about it they get easily agitated saying ""lena hai to lo ya jao"" and reasons like high demand are the replies.

i went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so i called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

finally he delivered food, when i checked gravy i found quantity was less than usual (50%). also some gravy was over the package. i immediately felt something is fishy. i suspect that he took away some part of food.

i opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. i could not report the case.

after waiting for while i cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

i was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

Food,vegetarianism in india has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,689,eogkmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/,343,2020-01-14 18:25:50,"
why do vegetarians in india prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? a look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. as is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. in caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously ‚Äì something best embodied by a brahmin.

the percentage of non-vegetarians among scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. and in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among brahmins at almost over 50%. the higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

the burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

broadly, present-day vegetarianism in india constitutes a form of moral power of minority within hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority ‚Äì with their consent. this new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

how fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? the morals of indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. in this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. the state across india through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",VelvetHedgehog,absolutely we re hypocritical bunch dung brains sense look beyond brahmin we d see thrive non vegetarian food diets beyond cringe see athletes say australian new zealand athletes,329,14,5.327327327327327,4.785714285714286,vegetarianism caste hierarchy love animals vegetarians prefer social distance non vegetarians look caste wise food preferences could provide insights common knowledge ranking castes mostly influenced purity occupation diet caste society achieve purity body spirit necessary vegetarian religious simultaneously something best embodied brahmin percentage non vegetarians among scheduled castes scheduled tribes men women much higher among communities latter group highest incidence vegetarianism found among brahmins almost 50 higher caste greater possibility pure vegetarians burden diet purity vegetarianism is however women men broadly present day vegetarianism constitutes form moral power minority within hindus power forced non vegetarian majority consent new sociality sign progress modern caste belief seductive power vegetarianism associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies spaces without dissent fragile must morals vegetarian castes feel threatened introduction eggs poor children schools morals vegetarians continue based less compassion humans animals driven ideas hierarchy purity scheme hierarchy eats beef placed lowest rung humans caste animals carry equal sympathy exists hierarchy cow indigenous jersey takes highest sacral form compared rest gandhi improvised vegetarianism inflicting violence control self present day caste subjects vegetarianism however thrive violence self others state across various governments mostly party process promoting hegemony misguided vegetarianism
Food,do indian restaurants actually use yeast to leaven naans?,22,g07a97,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g07a97/do_indian_restaurants_actually_use_yeast_to/,7,2020-04-13 13:03:03,"short version:

a  naan's crumb  seems to be just an airy bubbly layer and a bottom layer,  it is almost hollow in the middle, no bready glutenous structures,  image for reference: [https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg)   this makes me believe that it is not leavened with yeast but just  getting a lean flour on a high enough heat that seals the deal, so a phulka like internal structure, but with tandoor's heat you'd have the air bubbles in a phulka which collapse by the time you flip, actually crisped enough by the heat  to stay like that?

long version:

i'm  experimenting with trying  to recreate naans similar to restaurants in  india, which i believe is primarily the trick of tandoors. while most  recipes do the yeast/yogurt, the end result always for me is closer to a  bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan. i've seen   restaurants in european countries also do this, so i guess they leaven   with yeast, and this is relatively easier to recreate in home  conditions, this was my attempt [https://i.imgur.com/t9jcnms.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/t9jcnms.jpg)

going  back to naans in india however, the crumb is more of a very airy   structure, with just the top & bottom layers, importantly it doesn't  at all actually have bready interiors like a pita,  a perfect example  is [https://www.reddit.com/r/breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally\_got\_my\_hand\_on\_some\_real\_naan\_and\_roti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti/)

the   post there claims that the bread only contained flour water &  salt,  no diary and importantly no leavening.  the more i'm  understanding a  bit about bread etc, the more i'm feeling it is just  the heat of the  tandoor oven and just a lean flour, maybe with a bit of  yogurt for  flavor /soda and not a yeast bread. does anyone have links  to  videos/recipes from actual indian restaurants? most youtube videos  are  all from home cooks, where the recipe is either yeast/ baking   soda/powder, but trying all of them still gives a more ""breadier""  crumb   to naan, while i'm actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa   roti's crumb, except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the   top fast enough to stay there, while a tawa roti/phulka has a great air   bubble while roasting, but it doesn't sustain. i experimented this with   my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten   flour (don't have atta) , so i did get a lot of bubbles similar to   naans, however, it didn't stay after flipping, similar to how a   chappati/roti on griddle would have bubbles, but don't survive to stay   bubbled. [https://imgur.com/a/fj9phuj](https://imgur.com/a/fj9phuj) ,

so   i guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean   that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast, or the   restaurants may use a bit of yesterday's dough which would mean a   sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening?

1. since most of my friends are restaurant owners, i want to go meet everyone. i want to hug everyone i've known in the outside world and if i meet people i've had a falling out with, i'll hug them too. our problems are nothing. i really hope everyone makes it.
2. things i've taken for granted and really want to eat again.   
a)chocolate fucking cake. i'm buying atleast a kilo and the message is gonna be merry fucking christmas.   
b) mithai!!! if i knew things would escalate so quickly, i really would have stocked up. the only stock i have right now is of smokes and chocolates.   
c) samosa, and although vada pav makes me sick, i'm gonna eat that anyway. i miss it.  
d) pizza, burgers, fries, even coca cola(i'm anti anything by that company but now i'm desperate for some junk food) you name it.  
e) icecream!  
f) shawarma. oh my god i miss this terribly. 
3. things i want to drink- i don't really drink but when i do, i'm a spiced rum and coke person (thank you cambodia) but that being said, i definitely am going to buy myself some beer.
4. things i want to do- go trekking! i believe nature will be so amazing this time with barely any pollution. 
5. i also really want to go out on a long ride on my bike. right now my bike trips are limited to buying smokes (which ends in 5 mins) and i definitely need to go out more.
6. go for long walks, road trips, picnics, you name it. i'm not a ""religious institution"" person, but i'll do that too.
7. go watch any movie in a theater.
8. ride a local train. i miss the crowds.
9. probably you. (sorry just thought this was funny)

no jokes, i think the list could be longer but this sums up the main things i really wanna do. if any of you around would like to join me for any or all of these things, feel free to send me a message! we'll talk and keep in touch and whenever the chaos ends and the sun's shine is truly warm, a one that brings happiness, we'll hang out.

Food,beware of ordering peanut butter online,27,dfejlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dfejlq/beware_of_ordering_peanut_butter_online/,36,2019-10-09 22:50:17,"so there is growing awareness about nutrition and you get food products with and without sugar, sodium, vegetable oils. but unfortunately, when it comes to food industry, the word ""natural"" is very vague. see  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural\_foods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_foods)

recently i took a liking for peanut butter. i liked it very much. but i had eaten the sugar-free variety which someone got me from abroad. i prefer that. i looked everywhere in retail stores for unsweetened natural peanut butter without added sugar or added salt, vegetable oils. i couldn't find. all of the peanut butter on sale was heavily processed with added sugar, salt, emulsifiers, vegetable oils.

so i turned to amazon india for buying unsweetened peanut butter. and luckily i found several brands selling peanut butter without added sugar, oils etc. since then i have successfully been ordering unsweetened peanut butter on a regular basis from amazon india. it's not i don't know to look at the ingredients. however a recent experience made me lose trust in amazon india. after searching for unsweetened peanut butter, i came across a product labeled **all natural** peanut butter from a same brand as the previously ordered unsweetened variety.

i looked at the product packaging and description and it was the same as the unsweetened product i had purchased several times previously. i was in a hurry for work so i purchased it (quite a number of bottles in fact as i buy it in bulk). however it turned out be peanut butter with added sugar and salt. it turns out i had missed seeing 1 small line in 1 particular image out of 5-6 images. that line listed sugar, salt in fine print. all the rest of the description, labels, packaging was exactly the same as the unsweetened variety and the title which said all natural (which is why i got it).

i approached amazon india to give me a refund (food products like this are non-returnable) as i am very weight conscious, having lost 50 kg after childhood obesity, and i cannot have peanut butter with added sugar+salt in it. i explained to them that it was a bulk order and that most of the bottles were intact, sealed, unopened and refrigerated but it was not the product i wanted and i had been misled into buying it. they refused the refund, blamed me for not paying attention to the fine print and basically said they can't do anything and that i should approach the manufacturer.

i contacted the manufacturer (whom i will not name to protect their identity). they admitted that the varieties of peanut butter they had - unsweetened and processed had similar packaging except for that ingredients line. but what they told me about amazon was a revelation. they informed me that amazon india had taken over all of the marketing and sales of their brand of peanut butter. so they were only now a company responsible for manufacturing it and supplying it to amazon, not for the marketing and how it's advertised. also, the bottle itself only contains the word natural but for the sweetened variety, amazon made it all natural (whereas the *unsweetened* variety is actually just ""natural"" - go figure).

regardless, the manufacturing company admitted the packaging was similar enough to confuse anyone and it wasn't my fault especially since it was labeled all natural. the manufacturer was kind enough to give me a replacement for the peanut butter. but this is a lesson to learn. amazon in this case is not merely the seller of the product. they are responsible for the marketing too, as confirmed to me by the manufacturer and despite this, they refuse to bear responsibility for deceptively marketing it by selling it as all natural. i contacted their support multiple times via chat, phone, twitter and every time they refused to take responsibility.

so just be very careful while buying peanut butter from amazon retail or pantry. also, i will be taking this issue to food safety and standards authority of india (fssai) who can prohibit amazon from selling such falsely marketed products. (processed food sold as all natural). buyer beware. in this case, since retail stores were not carrying unsweetened peanut butter, i had to turn to amazon. but they screwed me like this.

now, the peanut butter from this particular brand comes in fact in 3 varieties, not just 2. they are all marketed by amazon confusingly:

\#1 ""**all** natural peanut butter (sweetened)"" - is clear that it has added sugar in it

\#2 ""unsweetened natural peanut butter"" (notice no ""all"" in the marketing - could also imply it has not been sweetened but is not all natural - can still contain unhealthy vegetable oils or salt or emulsifiers - some brands add these things so the oil doesn't separate from the crushed peanuts, but for this brand, it contains pure peanuts and nothing else)

\#3 ""**all** natural peanut butter"" (without the word sweetened but which also actually contains added sugar+salt so the extent that it tastes considerably sweet) - note how since #1 exists and is marked as sweetened and #3 does not carry that label, one would assume this to be devoid of separately added sugar especially if #2 is not listed at all on the same page. i'll admit that i should have looked at the ingredients like i usually always do but i ordered it in a hurry, having had a good experience with this brand earlier 3-4 times and because i didn't expect the packaging of all varieties to be exactly the same!

amazon has modified the description on the bottle for marketing reasons as the manufacturer revealed. the actual product packaging/label on the bottle only says natural creamy or natural crunchy, in which case i would still go hunting for the ingredients and see if sugar is added. but all natural meant without sugar to me (a hard lesson learned now) at least especially when the other is explicitly marked sweetened (i didn't even know there were 3 varieties, 6 actually if you consider crunchy vs creamy - all with same packaging). and now amazon absolve all responsibility.

**update**: what's worse is that i am even seeing listings on amazon where they are selling a two pack jar peanut butter with both jars in different colors. ingredients listed for only 1 jar which has no added sugar while the jar of other color has added sugar but ingredients of that bottle \*not listed in the 2 pack listing\*; only where that other colored jar is listed separately for purchase it shows that it has added sugar, palm oil, canola oil etc. so again, people looking at the ingredients in the 2 pack listing will order it having verified that one of the jars is free of added-sugar and after getting it realize the other jar had added sugar in it.

**update 2**: to make things worse, the replacement bottles were delivered in an unusable condition. due to poor packaging which caused spillage, they were coated with peanut butter completely:

[https://i.imgur.com/rzlwctf.png](https://i.imgur.com/rzlwctf.png)

due to such a bad experience, i have decided to make the brand name public anyway. it's **gourmet delicacy** peanut butter.

**update 3**: the nutrition label seems to be completely wrong as all three varieties list the same amount of sugar despite two containing added sugar and tasting significantly sweet.

i'm putting up this post to warn you people, that if you use swiggy, please be careful. please see the images that i've posted. the sad part is their escalation team accepted that there is a mistake and yet they don't care that they need to refund the money. please see the pictures below that tell the story.

greetings [/r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india)!

tomorrow, august 24, marks the first anniversary of the supreme court's decision on the right to privacy judgement. this marked an important point for the conversation around what it means to be free. to love, to share and to learn. privacy makes a lot of this possible. an essential part of a privacy right is to ensure india gets a law that protects people from the harmful use of digital technologies that profile and surveil them. one of the efforts to make sure this legal reform takes place is the saveourprivacy campaign which has proposed a model law called the indian privacy code, 2018 that is open for feedback and comment. some of the lawyers and policy experts will join the reddit community today between 6:30 - 7:30 ist to chat on not only this campaign but reflect in the broader privacy issues including the social media communication hub, mass cctv deployment, cambridge analytica.

if you have privacy badger installed on your browser, show up. if you use duckduckgo, show up. if you didn't link your aadhaar to anything, show up. if you worry about strong encryption preventing law enforcement agencies from doing their work, show up!

collectively, we are the #saveourprivacy drafting volunteers. our twitter handles are below.

inspired by this, in 2014, white swan foundation was founded. this week, we complete 4 years! 

on our portals, we offer content in six languages, have over 600 articles in english alone, and over 100 videos on our youtube channel. we‚Äôve also reached out to over 2000 people in our outreach programmes with schools, colleges, asha workers, etc. you can see some of those pictures [here.](https://imgur.com/a/2dfbo)

today, there is 20% chance that one of us will develop a mental health issue sometime in our lifetime. the treatment gap for mental health issues is over 85% which means for every 100 people with mental health issues, only 15 get treatment! we believe that the stigma of mental health and illness can be drastically reduced by knowledge and awareness.

we want to curate many more such conversations until going to a mental health professional for a mental health concern is just as easy and natural as going to a doctor for the flu!

we are students of iit indore who are currently in protest against certain antagonistic actions of the administration, laws and rules violation, dissolution of students gymkhana when issues are raised and the general official attitude of the administration that the students do not have a say in the official functioning of the institution.

[our previous thread is linked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7rq17h/requesting_help_from_redditors_for_the_entire/), as well as a few older ones about this particular iit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5824lx/iitindore_to_introduce_60_hostel_reservation_for/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4s29ba/pg_students_at_iit_indore_are_facing_some_severe/).

as you can clearly see in the aforementioned three threads, our iit has been at the centre of controversy for years, mainly due to an administration that believes in an autocratic style of functioning. this is an iit in which even faculties and staff are not allowed to speak to media (this is actually part of the iit indore statutes).

the aforementioned three reddit threads should provide the relevant background on the origin and cause of the current standoff and lack of official/written communication between students and the administration.

with that said and done, we welcome questions from the community at /r/india. we would also like you to go through the **[announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7vtxad/ama_announcement_protesting_students_from_iit/)** for this ama, where a brief (!!) background is given for the issues at hand.

hey, my name is raghav mandava, and i am one of the first comedians from delhi. i was at the very first open mic organized in delhi in the summer of 2009. i have played a major part in shaping the current comedy industry and even some of the comedians you may know today.

‚Ä¢ in 2010 i started a company called cheese monkey mafia for organizing open mics and pub gigs. many house hold names of today did their first five minutes at the shows i organized.

‚Ä¢ my additional skill set is best explained as a producer and talent scout. there is an article i wrote in 2015 about some of the upcoming comedians that i thought people should see, https://lbb.in/delhi/raghav-mandava-delhi-comics/

‚Ä¢ i have even shot sketches and videos for comedians, here is an example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dysrdh15xy8

‚Ä¢ in 2014/15 i worked with the australian high commission to host their comedy competition raw, where the winners went and performed in the melbourne comedy festival

‚Ä¢ in may 2014, i was lucky enough to be on the opening weekend of a comedy club in malaysia called the crackhouse.

‚Ä¢ 2017 got featured in gq man of the year edition, but not as one of the men of year.

‚Ä¢ basically, comedy mein kaafi masti maara hai aur kismet ka full fyada uthaya hai.

although i‚Äôm a bit of a social media recluse, i have noticed a lot of discussions about comedy in r/india popping up lately; i would love to add to it. if people here are curious about the inner workings of comedy, and how it has changed over the last decade, i would love to offer my insights. this is of course, if you would let me, because i don‚Äôt want to come across as someone is who is coming here to promote himself, but i really love comedy, and i like discussing it with people.

hey everyone!

i am jaya ramchandani. i am a science communicator and have recently started to teach ib physics and general science.

i have been working with innovative educational projects making astronomy and physics accessible to the general public. 

today, i am here to answer questions related to interdisciplinary projects like art meets science, informal, out-of-the classroom learning, and lifelong learning for all.

i co-founded 'the story of' foundation because while studying physics i found that a lot of the concepts at the atomic and particle level are similar to eastern philosophy. so i started to ask the question then, why doesn‚Äôt contemporary science talk more often to eastern philosophy? that was one of the bigger motivations behind setting up the platform. we involved artists and designers in a big way because they are great at thinking about abstract topics and giving them form.

you can see our past project the story of light 2015 here: www.thestoryoflight.org. the story of light received international recognition in the un‚Äôs international year of light education and outreach panel. 

in the upcoming project, the story of space 2017, http://www.thestoryof.org/space2017/ we welcome everyone to join us in goa from 10th november to 19th november for our festival. the story of space provides unique learning experiences around space exploration, migration, urban architecture and other contemporary issues associated with the word ‚Äòspace‚Äô. essentially, we explore ‚Äòspace‚Äô from multiple perspectives. artists, scientists, educators, and philosophers have all come to goa to create live experiences, a film program, installations, workshops, talks, and panels. the 10-day festival is for the general public, across generations, and is free for all to experience. story of space 2017.

we are a non-profit ngo and are a volunteer run project. you can make contributions on our page (link below). if you can't give anything but still want to support our cause please share our link with your friends, family and co-workers. with more people aware of our cause, we will be one step closer to our goal. donate - http://www.thestoryof.org/space2017/donate

i am sandeep goenka, co-founder of zebpay, an app-enabled bitcoin wallet and exchange.

**about bitcoin**

bitcoin is a digital asset and a payment system. it is commonly called a decentralized digital currency. it was invented in 2009. it is an open source software. this means, that no person, company or country owns this network just like no one owns the internet. the system is peer-to-peer, that is, users can transact directly without an intermediary like a bank, a credit card company or a clearing house. transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain. 

short explanation on what is bitcoin: https://youtu.be/jiellbfnama

a longer version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmu28mgihb4

**about zebpay & sandeep goenka**

zebpay is a bitcoin app available for android and iphones. it is the most popular bitcoin exchange in india. users can buy / sell bitcoins, top up airtime and buy vouchers of flipkart, amazon and more. zebpay is the first in the industry to launch bitcoin wallet app that enables bitcoin transactions using a mobile number without any complexities to understand bitcoin addresses, taking backups or fear of losing bitcoins. 

in just a year, zebpay app has clocked 150,000 downloads and crossed a turnover of rs 450 crores. after early adopters, bitcoins are attracting a new class of users like young professionals and hnis. users are now using bitcoin as an alternative investment. they are also using it for online shopping, airtime top up, paying bills and buying gift vouchers. we believe india will see an explosion of digital assets like bitcoins in next 2 years. zebpay is on a mission to spread digital assets and bitcoins in india.

AMA,"hello /r/india, i am tathagata satpathy. member of parliament, chief whip of bjd, editor of dharitri & orissa post. ama!",633,2z493l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2z493l/hello_rindia_i_am_tathagata_satpathy_member_of/,350,2015-03-16 02:00:44,"hello /r/india,

i am tathagata satpathy, elected member of parliament and chief whip of biju janata dal in lok sabha. this is the 4th time i am serving as an mp (12th, 14th, 15th & 16th lok sabha). i am a journalist by profession and i am the editor of two newspapers, dharitri (oriya) and orissa post (english).

[ama proof image]( http://imgur.com/rrdjgi9)

at the outset, i would like to tell you why i am doing this ama. this young man /u/kumbhakaran (*i wonder why but he prefers not to be named*) who works with me and helps me with my legislative work requested me to do this. i agreed. 

after hearing about this ama format of interaction, i thought it would be a good way to know what people think of the present situation in india. your questions might be a link to finding solutions to issues that are uppermost in the minds of people of a certain creed. 

being selfish, i would like to use these inputs sometime in parliament. i am not sure how this could help improve the overall situation (or solve problems) but reddit could prove to be an alternative communication channel for me. i am not on twitter or facebook. i like the anonymity that reddit offers. therefore i have dared to do this ama here.

my policy team, /u/kumbhakaran and /u/zainabhameed, will be helping me with this ama. they will also participate and respond.

**big disclaimer: the views expressed in this ama should definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. i am answering these questions as a citizen of india. all views expressed here are personal. same goes for my staff.**

so go ahead and ask me anything! this is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india community. 

*i will start answering questions at 7 pm (ist).*

edit (20:01 ist): thank you redditors for participating in my ama and a special thank you to the moderators. if some of you still have queries, please do post them. i will try to answer them sometime during this week. don't be surprised if you find me as a regular redditor after this. amen!

edit (19:53 ist, march 20, 2015): i got some brilliant points from redditors regarding the plight of the farming sector. yesterday, i had allotted the time of the bjd to a colleague who unfortunately, did not use them. i spoke today (limited party time) and used some of the points in the house. /u/kumbhakaran has uploaded the video already! after a not so busy week in parliament, let me try answering a few more questions.

we are walking along this route [https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1fblkd3w5vpbbwgh0g6tdk604ksw]


in the past, i have had the opportunity to cycle from calcutta to mumbai (2500kms), working on issues of child labour, child education and micro lending with cry and rang de. i also walked 700kms across rajasthan, highlighting the cause of shekhawati architecture and trying to understand micro lending issues in this region as well. through these endeavours, we could raise both funds and awareness for the mentioned causes, translating directly into impact at many fronts.

i have had experience of 2 years in varied roles from counter insurgency operations in meghalaya as commander of a surgical strike team, currently looking after the  conversion training of new cobra optees for combat conditioning

about cobra : cobra is a specialized unit of the central reserve police force (crpf) of india proficient in guerrilla tactics and jungle warfare. originally established to counter the naxalite problem, cobra is deployed to address any insurgent group engaging in asymmetrical warfare. currently numbering ten battalions, cobra is ranked among one of india's more experienced and successful law enforcement units. 

about crpf, which is my parent organisation : the central reserve police force is the largest of india's central armed police forces. it functions under the aegis of ministry of home affairs (mha) of the government of india. the crpf's primary role lies in assisting the state/union territories in police operations to maintain law and order and counter insurgency.

feel free to ask about the training regimes in making of a special force officer, weapons and any other stuff. kindly refrain from asking questions which are too political/ controversial/sensitive in nature as i will not be able to answer. i hope the good folks of r/india can understand that.  

in the end special thanks to the mods for this interaction and of you feel interested in joining the central armed police forces (crpf, bsf itbp, ssb, cisf) you can pm u/mrbighouse

AMA,"hi reddit, i'm siddharth agarwal & i'm currently on a walk (~3000kms) along the river ganga from sea to source and i have already walked 2000kms since 6th june. ama!",246,566cwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/566cwa/hi_reddit_im_siddharth_agarwal_im_currently_on_a/,67,2016-10-07 06:20:15,"this june, i started walking along the ganga from the ocean to the glaciers at 14000 feet, trying to present a very personal narrative of the ganga and stories of the people who affect and are affected by it. the experiences have maintained my understanding that there‚Äôs a need to bring these important conversations into the mainstream. this campaign will help us learn and share with you stories of the people of the basin who depend on the river and what urban/rural/industrial activities are doing to the river.

last time we did an ama [https://redd.it/4saxeh] i had covered 500kms and was waiting to sort out some logistical issues to continue the journey. 

current status :

i'm done with over 75% of the journey and it has been an exceptionally challenging task over the course of the past 4 months. for those who have been following the journey from the beginning, it might come as a surprise that i have been by myself and not accompanied by a documentary crew as was the case when i started (refer to previous ama). restricted by personal reasons and security concerns, the crew decided to drop out after they had covered the stretch in west bengal. though this affected the design of the project as envisioned and also induced a fair bit of mental agony, it helped me re-emphasize my belief that the only limitations are the ones that we put on ourselves.

what this has done though, is that it helped me survive longer on the road with the same amount of funds we were able to raise in the first round of crowdfunding. we'll soon be going live with a second round of crowdfunding, since the first round didn‚Äôt reach our target and use that to support the moving upstream series of projects, which is soon going to witness an expansion. this includes an opportunity for more young people to undergo river journeys with the support of veditum india foundation, to help us understand, visualize and thereby improve the situation at the grassroots.

AMA,"hey /r/india, i‚Äôm amrit, a delhi-based social entrepreneur and chatbot developer. ask me anything about air pollution!",88,5fvxfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5fvxfa/hey_rindia_im_amrit_a_delhibased_social/,95,2016-12-02 00:07:26,"air pollution sucks.

i believe that clean air is a basic human right. we are a very long way away from having clean air in delhi, most parts of north india, and around the world. air pollution in cities across the country even the likes of bombay and madras are unhealthy (just not as bad as delhi).


shocking facts about air pollution:

1. 92% of the people in the world  don't have access to clean air.

2. 6.5 million people die prematurely every year because of air pollution. that's more than hiv/aids, tuberculosis and traffic accidents combined.

3. scientists don't yet know the precise extent of health affects of sustained exposure to very unhealthy and hazardous air quality levels, because most air quality research thus far has been done in countries with relatively much much cleaner air than india.


there is no reason why air pollution data shouldn‚Äôt be as easy to access and understand as weather data. i‚Äôm working to make that happen for worldwide air quality data at http://www.airairair.org.

i built smokey - it's a friendly air pollution chatbot that works in facebook messenger. it is the easiest way to monitor the air quality levels in your city every day, and learn what you can do about it to protect yourself. you can search for ‚Äúsmokey air‚Äù in facebook messenger app, or just click on http://m.me/smokeybot. it's totally free and works like magic for cities around the world in 33 countries.


prior to this, i launched a simple twitter bot, [delhivsworld](http://www.twitter.com/delhivsworld) - it tweets out hourly updates to delhi's air pollution levels compared to beijing, london, new  york and sydney.


i definitely don‚Äôt have all the answers, but i want to hear your experiences about air pollution and help in any way i can, especially by democratizing air pollution data in a way that's super easy to access and understand for absolutely everyone with an internet connection.


**let‚Äôs talk air pollution.**

i have a simple question for you: do you know the air quality in your city today? do you wear a face mask? why or why not?

AMA,"hello /r/india. i am urjit yajnik, former dean of student affairs (dosa), iit bombay (circa 2011-15). ama",201,3c76fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3c76fm/hello_rindia_i_am_urjit_yajnik_former_dean_of/,275,2015-07-06 04:16:18,"hello all,  
this is urjit yajnik, physics professor, but also the unenviable erstwhile dean of student affairs, iit bombay from roughly during 2011 to 2015, a position fondly or otherwise called dosa.  

here is the [proof](https://i.imgur.com/bmcinpp.png).

i have agreed to do ama with due encouragement and prodding by [insight](https://www.facebook.com/insight.iitbombay), our own loveable if noisome media body. and they have offered to stand by me through this session, as much as media stand by officials, i guess.

let me set the ball rolling by what is on my mind as i face the large general body of people but majority of whom are most likely the sufferers of my ""regime"". i am opening up in this particular session to questions that are related to   

* matters pertaining to iit bombay; more generally to the iit system  
* higher technological education, in india and worldwide  
* general issues about career choices, future of the relationship between technology and society and what, with my limited crystal ball gazing abilities, may be your available strategies to navigate that.  

to kick off, let me make three points :  

1. what was my abiding motto for handing the dosa job? it was that students of iit bombay and of a campus and academic environment similar to iit bombay should live in a self-governed, participatory environment. as you know we have no resident wardens in individual hostels, though the faculty wardens are only a stone‚Äôs throw away. i relied mostly on the fact that students have a responsibility to their own lives and those of
their fellow residents of the campus. and i received ample justification to this belief, in the initiatives and tasks that student representatives or individuals took up, sometimes for the larger student body but often also just for that individual who needed help the most. 

2. iit bombay is at present blazing a trail. from the exposure to faculty research output, to the inspiration and infrastructure they receive from iit bombay, students and alumni have made the most to put the institute in the forefront. a large number of alumni and well wishers have also devoted substantial amounts of time and resources to make this happen. we see the culture of fundamental contributions to technology, to management and innovation, as well as to entrepreneurship to grow in the time to come.

3. career choices. as the world becomes both information loaded and also small in terms of the rapidity and reach of ideas and products, it becomes a challenge to decide how to steer and navigate through this environment. so long as you navigate yourself ethically and are making a definite contribution to the  larger good, you are fine.

well, so those are the thoughts with which i start. now let's ama away!

this ama is on behalf of my grandfather. a few days ago [i posted](http://imgur.com/a/rq210) pictures of his pre-independence british passport that was issued to him when he had to travel to the middle east in early 1947. the post generated a lot of interest and people had questions for him and requested an ama.

i've frequently talked to him about his experiences and he has told me bits and pieces over the years. it's really fascinating to listen to because it was a completely-different time, and it's amazing listening to someone who actually lived through those times.

my grandfather is 93 years old. he went to uc college in aluva, but didn't finish his degree, instead deciding to run away and join the military. he took a train from chennai to lahore for basic training, and then went to bombay for a wireless operators course. after that he spent a few months in hyderabad where he was promoted to sergeant. 

he was then posted to ramree island off the coast of burma with the 4th squadron of the royal indian air force to help them conduct recce operations against the imperial japanese army. after the end of the war he was offered a chance to be part of the british commonwealth occupation force in japan, but instead opted to leave the military.

he worked for kodak for a bit and then was offered a job with the iraq petroleum company, which he took. this was when he was issued his passport. 

because of his age and because he recently had some surgery he gets easily tired and i don't want to exert him too much. as a result he won't be able to answer your questions immediately. but please do post them and i will start going over them tomorrow morning and will transcribe his answers. also, there are some details he can't remember so i apologize in advance if he is not able to answer some of your questions.

**update 2**: taking a break for lunch - will come back after.

**update 3**: back after lunch and i've transcribed his responses to all of the other remaining questions. i'm finishing up now because my grandfather is getting tired (he's already coughing a little bit after talking so much). i'm sorry if we were unable to answer all your questions! my grandfather thanks you all and i want to thank the r/india mods for helping me organize this ama and the r/india community for making it a success. i've wanted to collect his thoughts and experiences from those years and this ama really helped me do that well. thank you all again!",_vi5in_,ever decided come back not why,498,21,4.666666666666667,5.523809523809524,ama hello u _vi5in_ grandfather the british passport issued became independent ama hello ama behalf grandfather days ago posted http imgur rq210 pictures pre independence british passport issued travel middle east early 1947 post generated lot interest questions requested ama ve frequently talked experiences told bits pieces years really fascinating listen completely different time amazing listening someone actually lived times grandfather 93 years old went uc college aluva finish degree instead deciding run away join military took train chennai lahore basic training went bombay wireless operators course spent months hyderabad promoted sergeant posted ramree island coast burma 4th squadron royal air force help conduct recce operations imperial japanese army end war offered chance part british commonwealth occupation force japan instead opted leave military worked kodak bit offered job iraq petroleum company took issued passport age recently surgery gets easily tired want exert much result able answer questions immediately please post start going tomorrow morning transcribe answers details can t remember apologize advance able answer questions ask anything http imgur 0m8sek0 proof http imgur j6yeqca edit 9 00 am ist right now grandpa let know doctor appointment back around 10 15 am ist answer rest questions sorry delay still interested answering questions update 1 grandpa back update taking break lunch come back after update 3 back lunch ve transcribed responses remaining questions finishing grandfather getting tired he already coughing little bit talking much sorry unable answer questions grandfather thanks want thank mods helping organize ama community making success ve wanted collect thoughts experiences years ama really helped well thank again

i have a passion for all things technology including internet and technology policy, and firmly believe that technology can transform indian politics and governance, our democracy and lives of all citizens. i believe that an enabling internet policy ecosystem, including a neutral internet, is crucial to the success of digital india.


i have worked as a chip designer at intel and worked on the 80486 and pentium chips, set up one of the first and largest greenfield indian cellular service bpl mobile, and then transitioned into being a technology entrepreneur. as an mp, i was also one of the petitioners in the supreme court pil against the draconian section 66a of the it act, which was struck down earlier this year.


i believe that the current debate on net neutrality is a result of the failure of our previous governments r to initiate a robust multi-stakeholder discussion on internet governance  model based structure for internet governance. for over three years now, i have argued that we must strive to create a multi-stakeholder based model for internet governance,  which would have also resulted in a conclusion and debate of net neutrality. 

i am doing this ama to:
1.	take a stab at addressing specific queries on the nuances of the net neutrality debate in india.
2.	take any inputs from this chat back into parliament and other interventions i shall be making with the government on the issue, and
3.	reinforce my commitment to the net neutrality fight and make my pro-neutrality position clear.

AMA,"hi /r/india, i‚Äôm shankar. i‚Äôm an out indian gay man living in chennai. ask me anything!",214,2b7pz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2b7pz6/hi_rindia_im_shankar_im_an_out_indian_gay_man/,322,2014-07-21 04:51:09,"i‚Äôm shankar and i‚Äôm 22 years old. i came out publicly on facebook in december 2013, a couple of weeks after the supreme court verdict reinstating section 377. i graduated in june 2013, and i was out to about twenty friends in college even before i posted on facebook. i told my dad when i was in third year of college, and my sister, a few months before i came out on facebook. 

life has been a roller-coaster ride so far: it wouldn‚Äôt be an understatement to say i felt suicidal multiple times a week when i was in college (not because i couldn‚Äôt accept i was gay - i had always known, but because of a couple of other experiences that are a direct result of being gay), but since coming out publicly, i‚Äôve managed to be a lot more happier and confident. i feel much less stressful than i used to, and i cannot even imagine how i managed to be in the closet for that long. 

i lived for 18 years in tuticorin (a small coastal town south of tamil nadu). before joining work at a tech startup in chennai, i did my engineering in another tier 2 town. 

if it matters: almost all of my best friends are straight. i‚Äôve never been harshly discriminated against (no one has come up to me and told me i suck because i'm gay) but i‚Äôve mostly felt like an outsider in college and school, and even today, i sometimes do (despite the fact that it might seem like i‚Äôm having it lucky).

a couple of links that can help you get a better idea of my life so far:

[my about.me profile](http://www.about.me/shankarganesh)

[my coming out post](https://medium.com/@_shankarganesh/coming-out-6f6a6c2f1139) (i deleted this from facebook because i was depressed again a few months after coming out - i had a copy in my email thankfully, which i later posted to medium) 

i‚Äôve also written about life as a [gay teenager in india](https://medium.com/@_shankarganesh/being-a-gay-teenager-in-india-91e8ea58463), and [how i dealt with my depression and suicidal thoughts](http://orinam.net/dealt-depression-suicidal-thoughts/). 

the first step to equality is visibility. talking about sexual orientation and gender identity is step #0 to securing gay rights. and that isn‚Äôt happening in india like in the us. there aren‚Äôt many out people, there aren‚Äôt many out celebrities (not that they have an obligation to come out), so i‚Äôm doing my tiny bit by being open about these topics today here. i‚Äôll be here for an hour so feel free to shoot your questions!

**edit 1: i'll be around till midnight. ask away!**

**edit 2: loving the questions. staying longer.**

**edit 3: i'm done. thanks, everyone!**

if you need to talk to me, i'm on twitter: [@_shankarganesh](http://www.twitter.com/_shankarganesh). 

if you're gay, bisexual or trans, and if you're feeling lonely or alienated or suicidal, remember: we're around. the only reason i did this ama is for you. there are resources, you just need to look for them. here's a start: [it gets better](http://www.itgetsbetter.org). and [orinam](http://www.orinam.net).

stay strong, we'll get there somehow: 377 will be gone, and one day your kids wouldn't have to think twice about having two moms or two dads or <insert other gender identities here>.

i am vahishta. in dec 2012 i quit my job and sold my house and began planning the rest of my life as a traveler. i spent six months of 2013 in the us, backpacking from the east coast to the west coast. i saw some crazy shit, in terms of mind-bendingly beautiful landscapes, amazing cities and incredible people. and the food. oh good lord, the food. you may have heard of me via my [blog](http://www.vahishta.com), or my [column in mumbai mirror](http://www.mumbaimirror.com/others/leisure/the-first-step/articleshow/20612506.cms) (which, i believe is also syndicated elsewhere in india.)

ask me anything! some common questions are: how i financed this adventure, what i do now, what my plans are next, stupid / mad stuff i did / saw...

i'm going to europe next, for around three months (hopefully! fingers crossed! visas are always iffy!) so you can ask me about that too!

btw this brings up an important question: i'm not sure how to prove i went where i did - i have pictures of the places i went to, but i'm not in most of them. just take my word for it, ok? :)

if you want more food for discussion, here are some pictures i took while traveling: http://imgur.com/a/axmsj

i am the sole techie who created one of the first third party ios web browser: 360 web browser (digital poke) in 2012. we then moved into promotion of third party apps via another company which we co-founded: 3 magic shots in 2013 (which was responsible for moving many apps to the top 10 of the us app store) before finally venturing into creating grabshack.

i would love to talk about technology or entrepreneurship or the experience of starting a new business or literally anything else /r/india might be interested in.

edit 1: guys, thanks for all the questions, i am replying to the answers to the replies now and of course will reply to anything else you have in mind.

in the end, i would say that my journey exist only because of my parents sacrifice, my wife's (richa / college sweetheart) continuous patience / understanding and love and my best friend (robin) for his sacrifices, i was lucky to have his wife (sakshi) as one to support us in our needs without caring for her own honeymoon period. so while, i was determined, it was only because of these peeps that we were able to reach where we are.

**the ama is now live (1800 ist)! i've included information about slum soccer and the homeless world cup below for your reference.**

**about slum soccer:**
slum soccer is a multiple award winning sport4development organization that uses football as a tool for the social upliftment of downtrodden demographics and at-risk youth. we work with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics, slum dwellers, street children, juvenile delinquents, and children of commercial sex workers. with more than 8000 at-risk youth enrolled in 37 centers across india, slum soccer has gone from strength to strength in the last 15 years.

we have specific programs tailored around the medium of football that focus on matters ranging from literacy and gender equality to de-addiction and natural resource management. we also conduct a wide range of football tournaments at local, state, and national level throughout the year in order to provide our charges with the football exposure their talent and tenacity deserves. we have been the official indian partner to the homeless world cup for 10 years now, and have proudly borne witness to team india's rise through the global rankings. the men's team now stands at rank 31 and the women's team at rank 5 - both all-time highs.

**about homeless world cup (hwc):**
founded by mel young and harald schmied in 2001, the homeless world cup is an annual football tournament that advocates for a global solution to homelessness and helps its participants untie the social albatrosses on their necks. with partners in more than 70 countries, the competition touches the lives of 100,000 homeless people every year through experience sharing and an infusion of respect and importance that their lives have lacked so far.

here is an old but still relevant video about the homeless world cup and team india's rising popularity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5auraansua

**homeless world cup glasgow 2016:**

i am arun rajasingh from chennai and is suffering from a rare genetic disorder which has caused my right leg to weigh about 100kgs. i need the help of fellow human beings and i am willing to answer the questions that they would have.i was leading a close to normal life despite of my oversized leg until 5 years back. since then, i am confined to a room and mobility is very difficult due to my oversized right leg. 

even this this disorder, i managed to complete engineering in a college 700km away from home and now i run my own it firm - kenriche technologies, http://www.kenriche.com.

i have a gofundme campaign here, https://www.gofundme.com/arunmobility which you can visit to read more details about me and there is also a campaign organized by milaap here, https://milaap.org/campaigns/movement_ceo.

i have got a fully customized wheelchair some days back (thanks to the gofundme campaign) but now i am hoping for a modified vehicle which will help me move around and thus, improve my business. i am currently working only from home as mobility is a big problem and i feel that if i am able to move around, i will be able to get my business to another height and excel in that field.

i would like to have an ama session. thanks for reading.

the felloships across india are funded by different funding bodies, dbt-dst already annouced their notification and are disbursing the fellowships, icmr followed in feb'15 and last night mhrd released its notification. other funding bodies such as csir are yet to release any notification. there are still inconsistencies between notifications issued by different authorities. there are other hardships students across the country face - such as getting irregular disbursement of scholarships. some students get paid only once a year with payments prededucted and we end up not having control over our own money. we are still working towards getting our demands met.

our website is: http://slumsoccer.org/

**the ama is now live (1800 ist)! i've included information about slum soccer and the fifa diversity award below for your reference.**

**about slum soccer:** slum soccer is a multiple award winning sport4development organization that uses football as a tool for the social upliftment of downtrodden demographics and at-risk youth. we work with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics, slum dwellers, street children, juvenile delinquents, and children of commercial sex workers. with more than 8000 at-risk youth enrolled in 37 centers across india, slum soccer has gone from strength to strength in the last 15 years.

late last month, slum soccer became the first indian organization to win fifa's inaugural diversity award, pipping organizations such as kickitout to the award. we are very proud of this achievement and our projects that have led to this achievement.

AMA,"hi /r/india, i am abhishek verma, director of critically acclaimed short film chasni. i am currently working on my next 2d animated short film 'maacher jhol (the fish curry)' on homosexuality. ask me anything!",60,3x2l73,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3x2l73/hi_rindia_i_am_abhishek_verma_director_of/,44,2015-12-17 01:50:17,"greetings r/india,

i am abhishek verma. currently i am working on my next 2d animated short film maacher jhol (the fish curry). it is about the difficult situation of a 34 year old gay indian man lalit who finally decides to reveal his true sexuality to his father. he decides to do so over a meal, his father's favourite dish maacher jhol.

this movie talks about acceptance from friends and family, which is very difficult to find even today in india. you can ask me anything about the film, the art of 2-d animation,  the techniques i use and why i am making this film. 

**bio**: i completed my masters in animation & film design from industrial design center, iit bombay (india) in 2014. i am a graduate in computer science & engineering. i am currently based in delhi working as a motion designer & independent film maker. i keep special interest in story-telling, experimental narrative, illustration, cinema analysis and typography. [chasni](http://www.jamuura.tv/video/219/chasni) was my first animated film. it was screened in over 30 international film festivals and bagged 11 awards across its journey including: 

* digicon 2014 award japan 
* silver award for best short film tasi (animation society of india) 
* 2014 runner up film indian film festival, melbourne-2014 
* best short film world festival of animation 
* animafest-zagreb 2014 croatia 
* ficci frames-14 india

the 2d hand-drawn animation is a complex medium but has a strong appeal. 1 sec of animation involves 8-12 drawings and that too coloured. so for a minute of animation it needs 500 drawings to run and appear as a moving image. the film maacher jhol is 11 min 30 secs, so there will be around 5000 drawings needed to create a moving frame.

**‚Äúmaacher jhol (the fish curry)‚Äù** is currently under production.

edit - thanks everyone for being a part of this ama. it was great answering all your questions! i am running a crowdfunding campaign for my next film maacher jhol it would be great if you could support the project by contributing to the campaign or even by spreading a word on social media. here is the link - www.ketto.org/maacherjhol.

if you have any more questions regarding the film you can always pm me

thanks again!

i'm shrikant and i do a show called ""morning no. 1"" on 93.5 red fm, in pune.

i'm a huge fan of reading (h2g2, but actually anything by douglas adams, got currently) writing (just look at the size of this post, bhai!) and arithmetic (2+2=5, you know?). i'm also known as the crazy guy who talks stuff on radio, early in the morning.

here's a brief history of ~~ti~~me:

i started out wanting to be an astrophysicist, studied at iucaa (inter-university center for astronomy & astrophysics) then landed a job as a content-writer, moved on to technical writing, won an rj hunt in 2006-ish, worked with radio mirchi on the evening drive-time show ""bumper 2 bumper"" for three and a half years, after which i quit with nothing planned.

for four years after that, i tried my hand at various things: i 'won' nanowrimo in 2010, ran a short-story blog-cum-magazine called d.ustb.in for a while (defunct currently) - then contributed a chapter to a book about being a radio jockey called ""our career diaries"". 

then i hit upon an app idea, and took to learning python and basic android development, hit upon a few more ideas and started learning django. i churned out a couple of web-apps, that are currently running on free heroku dynos [hashpix](http://hashpix.herokuapp.com), [@updt_me](http://update-me.herokuapp.com) and the most recent, [voteyatra](http://voteyatra.in)

a couple of months ago, i joined 93.5 red fm, pune as the rj for the morning show ""morning no. 1"" that airs from 7 am to 11 am on week days, i.e. monday to friday. 

**tomorrow, the 6th of june, i'm going to attempt to set a record as the first radio jockey to host a four-hour radio show - 7 am to 11 am - while sitting in the water! /r/pune ka naam roshan karungaa main!**

here's my proof: [twitter](https://twitter.com/rjshrikant/status/474524076648591360)

those of you who read dna in pune, might have noticed this on the 3rd page of today's 'after hrs' supplement: [famous rj to host first-ever radio show from water.](http://epaper.dnaindia.com/story.aspx?id=65358&boxid=43840&ed_date=2014-06-05&ed_code=820043&ed_page=3)
